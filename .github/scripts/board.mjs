/**
 * The board lives in Linear (team GRV, the Groove project); this is what makes
 * moving a card there do something. Run by `.github/workflows/board.yml`.
 *
 *   node board.mjs poll   Every five minutes. Reads the columns and writes to
 *                         $GITHUB_OUTPUT the work each one asks for:
 *                           ship=["GRV-12", …]      cards in Ready (moved to In Progress here)
 *                           rework=[{issue,prs,comment}, …]  cards sent back to In Progress with PRs open
 *                           mentions=[{issue,comment,reply}, …]  comments that say @claude
 *                           milestone=["GRV-40", …] new bugs with no milestone
 *                         and approves the open PRs of every card in Approved.
 *   node board.mjs pr     On a pull_request event: a PR that closes a card
 *                         puts it in QA (or Ready For Review when it changes the
 *                         security rules); the PR that completes a card merging
 *                         puts it in QA; the PR that closes a card merging puts
 *                         it in Done.
 *
 * Nothing here needs a cursor or a webhook. Every rule reads the card's own
 * state and the comments on it, so a poll that runs twice does the work once:
 * Ready is left as soon as it is seen, and a run announces itself on the card
 * (a "Picking this up" comment) before its agent starts, which is what the
 * next poll sees. The product owner only ever moves cards and comments; the
 * automation moves them on. See CLAUDE.md, "The board", and docs/linear.md.
