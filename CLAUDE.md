# Groove - Development Guide

## Project Overview

Groove is a browser-based music production tool designed to make music creation accessible and intuitive. It features real-time collaboration, AI assistance, pattern-based sequencing, and a library of sounds and instruments.

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **SolidJS 2** (`solid-js@2.0.0-rc.3`) - Reactive UI framework
  - Use SolidJS best practices: signals, stores, and effects
  - Store APIs (`createStore`, `reconcile`, `snapshot`, `storePath`) come from `solid-js` itself — there is no `solid-js/store` subpath
  - Control flow (`Show`, `For`, `Switch`, `Match`, `Loading`, `Errored`) and the `JSX` types come from **`@solidjs/web`**; `solid-js` no longer exports a `JSX` namespace, and there is no `solid-js/web`. (`@solidjs/web` re-exports the control-flow components from `solid-js`, so either import resolves to the same component — most of the repo names `@solidjs/web`.)
  - `Suspense` is `Loading` and `ErrorBoundary` is `Errored`; `Errored`'s fallback receives the error as an **accessor** (`(err, reset) => ... err().message`). See `src/app.tsx`
  - Use `createEffect(compute, apply)` for side effects and `createMemo` for derived values — see "Effects and Cleanup" below, and read it before writing one
  - Utilize Context providers for global state (see the `AuthProvider` pattern in `src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx`)
- **`@solidjs/vite-plugin`** - The serving layer, in **client start mode** (`solid({ start: true })` in `vite.config.ts`). It owns the dev server, the generated entries, and the build. There is no `@solidjs/start` release for Solid 2 and there is not meant to be one — Start is a mode of this plugin now, which is why the repo carries no `app.config.ts`, no `vinxi`, and no `src/entry-client.tsx`/`src/entry-server.tsx`
- **Vite 8** - Build tool and dev server (`vite.config.ts`, which pins port 3000 and documents the client-start-mode decision)

### Backend & Data
- **Firebase Authentication** - User authentication and session management
- **Firebase Firestore** - Real-time database for project storage and synchronization
  - There is no SolidJS/Firebase integration library in the stack; the repository layer owns its own subscriptions (`ProjectRepository.watchProject`)

### Audio
- **Tone.js** - Web Audio API library for audio synthesis and playback
  - Used by `ProjectAudioGraph` (the stable, ID-keyed graph) and `src/editor/useProjectAudio.ts` (the hook that wires one open project onto it) for audio playback and synthesis

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode enabled
- **Bun** - Package manager and runtime
- **Biome** - Linting and code formatting
- **Vitest** - Testing framework with jsdom

## Task tracking and landing work

Work is tracked in **GitHub issues** in `trygroove/groove`. The issue body is the spec: what to build or fix and how to tell it works. Its comments carry progress, decisions and blockers. Readiness is the issue's native `blocked_by` graph (`gh api repos/trygroove/groove/issues/<n>/dependencies/blocked_by`); dependency prose in a body is descriptive only. **`gh` in a Claude Code cloud session:** `gh api` REST calls work, `blocked_by` reads and edits included, even though `gh auth status` says the token is invalid (ignore it). GraphQL is blocked there, so `gh pr create/list/view` and `gh issue view/list` fail; use `gh api repos/trygroove/groove/...` or the GitHub MCP tools instead. In Actions every `gh` command works. The `blocked` label marks a task gated on an undecided `DEC-*` product decision. [`docs/prd.md`](./docs/prd.md) holds the product's principles, not its features; only the product owner edits it.

### The board

Status is a `status:*` label on the issue, and the pinned **Board** issue lists every open issue by column (`.github/workflows/board.yml`, `.github/scripts/board.mjs`). An issue is in exactly one column: add the new `status:*` label and the Action removes the old one.

| Column | Label | Moved there by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backlog | `status:backlog` | Opening an issue |
| Ready | `status:ready` | The product owner, once the spec is agreed and nothing still landing is in its way (see below). **This starts `/ship`** in Actions and moves the card on to In progress |
| In progress | `status:in-progress` | `/ship` starting; a failed QA; the product owner sending it back |
| Blocked | `status:blocked` | `/ship` stopping on an unclear issue or a failed run; QA failing twice |
| QA | `status:qa` | A PR labelled `deploy-preview` for the issue opening (QA'd on its preview) |
| Ready for review | `status:review` | A PR for the issue touching a gated path (labelled `needs-approval`); the QA bot passing a preview |
| Approved | `status:approved` | The product owner, to merge its gated PRs. `merge.yml` queues them and the merge queue lands them |
| Done | (closed) | The PR that closes it merging. The QA bot then tests it on production, and reopens it on a failure |

The Backlog column is grouped by milestone, and every issue has one: `.github/workflows/milestone.yml` puts a new bug on the milestone of the area it is in and anything else on Backlog. Milestones are listed by title (`M1`, `M2`, …, numbers compared as numbers), with Backlog last. Milestones can be added, renamed and renumbered freely: the scripts read them live, and the only name they rely on is `Backlog` (any case), the catch-all. An issue labelled `needs-shaping` has open questions (listed in a comment on it) to settle in a shaping session before it can go to Ready; the board shows that label, and `human-input-required`, after the issue's number on its line, and lists those issues first in their milestone. A PR that changes `firestore.rules` or `storage.rules` gets no preview; like any gated PR, it moves its issue to Ready for review. If an issue ever carries two `status:*` labels, the next board render keeps the later stage (Blocked always wins).

**Avoiding merge pile-ups.** Before moving an issue to Ready, look at the open PRs and the In progress cards. If the new work would touch the same files, or the same module where both change behaviour, leave it in Backlog until that work has merged: two changes landing at once in one area is how merge conflicts start. `/ship` makes the same check when it starts: if an open PR is likely to conflict, it holds off, comments on the issue naming the PRs it waits for, and puts the card back in Backlog. Move it to Ready again once they have landed.

The QA bot ([`docs/qa-bot.md`](./docs/qa-bot.md) holds its instructions) follows every merged PR back to the issue its body names and tests that issue on production, as the QA account, once the PR that closes it has merged and deployed; a PR whose issue is still open it ignores. On a pass it comments a summary on the issue and leaves it closed; on a fail it comments the findings on the issue starting with `@claude` (which starts a fix in a new PR), reopens it and adds `status:in-progress`, or `status:blocked` after the second failure. The rare open PR labelled `deploy-preview` it tests on the preview as well, before it merges: a pass adds `status:review`, a fail comments on the PR the same way. An agent working an issue keeps its card current the same way.

**Sending a card back.** To ask for changes on an issue whose PRs are open, comment the feedback on the issue or a PR, then add `status:in-progress` (not `status:ready`, which starts a fresh build). The board runs a rework agent on the open PRs, which fixes them in place, replies to the feedback, and moves the card back to QA (or Ready for review if there's no preview). It stands down if an `@claude` run is already on it, as after a failed QA.

### Shape, then ship

Every task runs in two phases:

1. **Shape (interactive).** The product owner and Claude work the issue out together in a session: questions, prototypes, design studies. It ends with the agreed spec written into the issue body. Ask as many questions as it takes here; this is the cheap place to be wrong.
2. **Ship (unattended).** **`/ship #123`** (`.claude/skills/ship/`, running `.claude/workflows/solid-groove-ship.js`) takes the issue from spec to PRs that merge themselves once green, with no further questions. When an issue ships as several PRs, it opens them one at a time, each after the one before has merged. If one of them is gated, the run waits as long as it can and then stops, saying so on the issue; approving that PR and moving the issue to Ready again continues from what has landed. It works out which of three kinds of work the issue is and scales the process to it:

| Kind | What it is | Tests | Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | New capability: one PR, or a few in sequence | Unit/component tests, plus a core flow when the feature adds a new user journey | Adversarial review, up to two fix rounds |
| **Fix** | Something is wrong | A regression test that fails before the fix (keep the red output for the PR body) | None |
| **Polish** | A small enhancement or tweak | A unit test where the behaviour is testable | None |

Whether the issue says "bug" or "enhancement" does not matter. Behaviour that works as coded but is not what the product owner wants is still a change to make: never stop because something "is expected behaviour". Ship stops only when the issue is genuinely unclear (two reasonable readings would build materially different things) and comments the question on the issue.

Quality outside features is kept by periodic code-quality and architecture sweeps that open their own cleanup issues, not by reviewing every small change.

### Core flows

A **core flow** is one user journey that must work end to end, written in plain English in [`docs/core-flows.md`](./docs/core-flows.md) with a stable ID (`CF-001`, …) and reproduced by `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/<ID>.spec.ts`. Flows are for journeys worth guarding for the life of the product, not for every feature.

- A feature that adds such a journey gets its flow written by the agent shipping it, as its **own PR, landed first**: the register entry and the spec, marked `test.fixme`. The PR that completes the feature removes the `fixme` and makes it pass.
- An existing flow's assertions are not weakened to fit an implementation. If one has to change, the PR body says what changed and why.
- `bun run verify:core-flows` enforces one spec per registered flow and lists any flow still parked at `fixme`.

### Landing work

- **Open PRs ready for review, not as drafts.** The product owner is the only reviewer; a draft just hides finished work.
- **Always open the PR yourself.** Work that ends as a pushed branch with a "Create PR" link is lost: nobody clicks it. Every run that pushes a branch for an issue, including an `@claude` run from `claude.yml`, opens its PR (`gh pr create`, or the GitHub MCP `create_pull_request`) before finishing, and checks it exists.
- **Title:** `Implement #<issue>: Title` for a feature or polish, `Fix #<issue>: Title` for a fix. The title says what the PR does (for a fix, what was broken). A sequence of PRs for one issue says its position in the body ("2 of 3, follows #<prev>"), not the title.
- **Body:** `Closes #<n>` on the PR that completes the issue, `Refs #<n>` on earlier ones. The merge closes the issue, which is what tells the QA bot to test it on production; a failed QA reopens it. Then what changed; the commands run and their results. Follow `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- **Every PR targets `main`, and small is the preference.** One PR per issue is the default, and around 400 changed lines is the sign a change wants splitting: a preference, not a cap, so a bigger PR that is one coherent change is fine. An issue may ship as **several PRs in sequence**, each landing before the next opens: a catalog, schema or pure refactor change first and the feature built on it after; a core flow at `test.fixme` before its implementation. Keep the sequence as short as the dependencies allow; parts that do not depend on each other belong in separate issues. Each PR leaves `main` working on its own. Tests ship in the same PR as the code they cover. Never mix a behaviour change into a pure move.
- **No stacked PRs.** A PR is never based on another PR's branch, and nothing rebases or force-pushes a branch that has an open PR. The next PR in a sequence opens once the one before it has merged, with `main` merged into its branch first (`/ship` waits for that merge and does this itself). When `main` moves under an open PR so that it no longer merges cleanly, `.github/workflows/conflicts.yml` labels it `merge-conflict` and asks `@claude` to merge `main` into the branch; a PR that still merges cleanly is left alone, because the merge queue tests it on top of `main` anyway. A rejected push means someone else pushed the branch: `git pull` (a merge, not a rebase) and push again. Never use `gh stack` or another `gh` extension (they are not installed, and some need GraphQL that agent sessions cannot reach).
- **Screenshots: required whenever any UI changes** (markup, CSS, copy). Show the changed state, and the before state when that helps; usually one to five images, never a dump of every step, never none. Capture them with the helper in `tests/e2e/support/walkthrough.ts` from any emulator-suite spec (a flow spec, or a scratch `tests/e2e/emulator/<slug>.screens.spec.ts` run with `bun run screenshots -- <spec>`), then `bun run walkthrough:publish -- --issue <n>` pushes them to the `claude/walkthroughs` branch and prints the Markdown for the PR body. Images cannot be attached through the GitHub API, which is why they live on a branch. Keep each image URL under 150 characters (the agent environment wraps longer ones in backticks and they render broken), and after updating a body check every image returns `200`. A PR with no UI change says so.
- **QA is after the merge.** The app is a work in progress, and nothing is hidden behind feature flags yet: every merge deploys to production, and the QA bot tests the issue there once the PR that closes it lands. So each PR must leave `main` working (the feature may be unfinished; nothing that worked before may break). A preview is optional: add `deploy-preview` to a PR only to see it before it merges. A preview runs against the **live production** backend with production's rules, so never label a PR that changes `firestore.rules` or `storage.rules`.
- **Merging:** `.github/workflows/merge.yml` queues every PR on its own once it opens or is pushed, unless it is a draft, is labelled `hold`, or touches a **gated path**: `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, `firebase.json`, `src/domain/`, `src/persistence/`, `functions/`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `release.config.mjs`, `.github/` or `.claude/` (the list is `GATED` in `.github/scripts/merge.mjs`). Those change stored data, access, server code, dependencies or the automation itself, which tests do not fully cover. A gated PR is labelled `needs-approval` and its card goes to Ready for review; the product owner approves the whole issue by moving it to Approved (`status:approved`), or one PR by adding that label to it. Keep a gated change in its own PR, landed first, so the rest is not held up. The queue tests each PR on top of `main` and the PRs ahead of it, so `main` only receives green combinations. When a queue run fails, `.github/workflows/ci-failure.yml` comments the run on the PR with `@claude` and moves the issue back to In progress; the fix's push re-queues it. If `main` still goes red, the same workflow reverts the PR that broke it through the queue and files a `Re-land #<pr>` issue. An agent never merges, never adds `status:approved`, and never removes `needs-approval` or `hold`.
- **Contracts:** domain schema, command registry, parameter definitions, persistence layout, selection, audio projection and rendering projection are contracts. Changing one is fine when the task needs it, but update every contract test and consumer in the same change and say so in the PR body.
- Git history is the completion record; do not put a commit hash into a commit. Do not preserve compatibility with prototype project data (schema v1 is the first production schema).

### Definition of done

- The issue's spec is met, including the failure and empty states it touches. A deliberate deviation is stated in the PR body with its reason.
- `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test` and `bun run check` pass. Work that touches browser, Firebase, audio or export behaviour also runs that suite.
- New behaviour goes through shared commands and boundaries, not a feature-specific mutation path.
- **Analytics ships with the feature.** A new or changed user action emits its events through the typed catalog in `src/analytics` (extend the catalog in the same PR, at minimum a `feature_first_use` key), with a test that it fires once per action. No ad-hoc event strings.
- No event or error-report parameter carries a project, track, clip, section or asset name, assistant text, a user-entered string, an asset URL, or a token.
- UI changes carry screenshots; every PR is ready for review and leaves `main` working.
- No unrelated formatting, dependency, generated-file or refactor churn.

bun run walkthrough:capture                  # Capture step() screenshots from the core-flow specs (emulator backend)
bun run walkthrough:publish -- --issue <n>   # Push the images and print the Markdown for the PR body
```

An environment that cannot reach `cdn.playwright.dev` — Claude Code on the web
included — can only install Chromium. Run the `:chromium` pre-flight there for
any change that touches the browser. Per push, CI runs only the emulator suite's
`@sanity` subset in Chromium (one pass through each major surface; tag a spec's
`test.describe` with `{ tag: "@sanity" }` to add it, sparingly). The full
emulator browser suite, in every browser, run once a day on `main` and on demand from the
Actions tab ("Run workflow" on CI); a failed daily pass opens a bug, and tests
that only passed on a retry open a flaky-tests bug. A green Chromium-only run is
not the PRD section 10 gating evidence and must not be reported as one.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup, the three backends the app can run against (mock, Firebase Emulator, real project), and the day-to-day loop; [`docs/testing.md`](./docs/testing.md) for what each suite covers, how CI gates on them, and the shared test helpers (`src/shared/id.ts`, `src/shared/clock.ts`, `src/testing/fixtures.ts`).

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles
- **Keep code tidy and modular**: Break out functions and components to keep them simple, clear, and easy to read
- **No long, complex blobs**: If a function or component is getting too long, split it into smaller pieces
- **Prefer third-party dependencies**: Use well-maintained libraries rather than implementing common functionality from scratch
- **Use TypeScript strictly**: The project has `strict: true` enabled

### SolidJS Best Practices

1. **State Management**
   - Use `createStore` (from `solid-js`) for complex nested state updates (see `src/editor/useEditorSession.ts`). `produce` is gone — mutating the draft **is** the setter's default behaviour: `setState((draft) => { draft.project = next; })`
   - Domain state changes only through the command layer (`src/commands`); a component never mutates a `Project` directly
   - Export setter functions rather than exposing setters directly
   - Keep stores focused on a single domain (auth, editor session, etc.)

2. **Context Providers**
   - Follow the pattern in `AuthProvider.tsx:18`
   - The context object **is** its own provider: `<AuthContext value={state}>`, not `<AuthContext.Provider value={state}>`
   - `createContext<T>()` with no default returns `T` from `useContext` and throws `ContextNotFoundError` when no provider is mounted, so there is no `as T` cast to write and no throw-wrapper hook to hand-roll
   - Always provide a typed hook for consuming context (e.g., `useAuth()`)

3. **Effects and Cleanup**
   - `createEffect` is split in two: `createEffect(compute, apply)`. **Only the compute half is tracked.** A reactive read moved into the apply half compiles, runs once, and then silently never re-runs — enumerate every reactive read an effect needs and keep all of them in the compute half
   - The apply half is where a write belongs: a signal or store write inside a tracking scope throws in dev, and the apply half is not a tracking scope
   - **Cleanup is the value the apply half returns**, not a nested `onCleanup`. `onCleanup` still exists and is still right at the top level of a component or hook body (see `src/editor/useEditorSession.ts`); what changed is that it no longer nests inside an effect
   - Example pattern:
   ```typescript
   // A subscription with no reactive dependencies: compute returns a constant,
   // the apply half opens the subscription and returns its teardown.
   createEffect(
     () => undefined,
     () => {
       const unsubscribe = service.subscribe(...);
       return () => unsubscribe();
     },
   );

   // A subscription keyed on something reactive: that key is read in compute.
   createEffect(
     () => props.id(),
     (id) => {
       const unsubscribe = service.subscribe(id, ...);
       return () => unsubscribe();
     },
   );
   ```
   - Worked examples: `src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (both shapes), `src/app.tsx` (`SurfaceTracker`, two reads in one compute), `src/components/TelemetryDisclosure.tsx` (a write that is only legal in the apply half)
   - `onMount` is `onSettled`, and it **returns** its cleanup rather than nesting `onCleanup` (see `src/app.tsx`)

4. **Component Structure**
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Extract complex logic into separate functions or composables
   - Use functional components with props typing

### Firebase Integration

1. **Authentication**
   - Use AuthProvider for app-wide auth state
   - Access via `useAuth()` hook
   - AuthProvider automatically redirects unauthenticated users to home

2. **Firestore Data Access**
   - All Firestore operations go through the schema-v1 `ProjectRepository` boundary (`src/persistence`), obtained via `getProjectRepository()` (`src/projectRepositoryClient.ts`) — never call `firebase/firestore` directly outside `src/persistence/firestoreProjectRepository.ts`
   - The one other module allowed to import `firebase/firestore`, and the only one allowed to import `firebase/storage`, is `src/userLibrary/firebaseUserLibraryRepository.ts`: the personal library's packs and audio (#282), behind `UserLibraryRepository` and obtained via `getUserLibraryRepository()`. It never hands out a download URL; audio is read back as the signed-in user with `readAudio`
   - `src/access/firestoreAccessRepository.ts` may import `firebase/firestore` too: the alpha allowlist and its refused sign-ins (#854), behind `AccessRepository` and obtained via `getAccessRepository()` (`src/accessRepositoryClient.ts`). Only an `admin: true` claim gets past `firestore.rules` there
   - Use `ProjectRepository.watchProject` for the metadata tier's live revision; `EditorSession` wires it into `ProjectAutosave`
   - Security rules enforce owner-based access (see firestore.rules)

3. **Data Flow Pattern**
   ```
   Component → typed command → CommandHistory.execute() (EditorSession) → new Project revision
     → ProjectAutosave queues the changed tier → ProjectRepository → Firestore
   Firestore → ProjectRepository.watchProject → ProjectAutosave.applyRemote() → Component reactively updates
   ```

### Path Aliases
- Use `~/*` to reference files from `src/` directory (configured in tsconfig.json:20)
- Example: `import { useAuth } from "~/auth/AuthProvider"`

### TypeScript
- Define domain types in `src/domain` alongside their runtime schema
- Use discriminated unions for variant types (see the domain Instrument and ClipContent types)
- Leverage `Partial<T>` for update operations

## Architecture Patterns

### Canonical domain model (`src/domain`)
- `src/domain` is the authoritative schema-v1 contract. Its types, Zod schemas, invariants, and tests replace any separate domain-model document.
- It has no Firebase, Tone.js, or SolidJS imports. Persistence, commands, audio, and rendering consume it from outside; audio nodes and Firestore `Timestamp`s never enter project state.
- Persistent relationships use prefixed IDs from `createIdFactory()` (`createSeededIdFactory()` in tests), never array positions.
- Musical time is integer ticks at 192 PPQ. Seconds, bars/beats/16ths, and pixels are derived through `src/domain/time.ts`.
- A user-controlled numeric value declares its range, unit, default, clamping policy, and automation capability once in `src/domain/parameters.ts`; UI, validation, audio, and assistant tools read that definition instead of repeating literals.
- **Asset identity is pack-qualified**. A `Pack` (`pak_` ID, name, `major.minor.patch` version, publisher, kind, description, one rights position) describes *library* content and is never stored inside a project; an `Asset` names the `packId` and `packVersion` it resolved from. A project's `metadata.packDependencies` is the derived list of those packs — `derivePackDependencies(song)` computes it, `executeTransaction` recomputes it once per transaction, `saveSong` writes it to the metadata tier, and `parseProject` rejects a list that has drifted from the song's assets in either direction. Unresolvable audio is a reported state from `resolvePackAvailability`, naming the affected tracks and clips, never a dangling reference or a substituted version. It resolves per *asset*, not per version string: the caller supplies the pack versions it holds along with the asset IDs each contains, so a pack that gained sounds still resolves, a pack held at no version is a missing pack, and a deleted sound is a missing asset. See [`docs/persistence.md`](./docs/persistence.md#packs-and-pack-qualified-assets).
- `parseProject` is the only way to obtain a `Project`. It either returns a fully valid project or a list of issues, and never partially repairs input.
- Changing this contract is its own task (a dedicated GitHub issue), not incidental work inside a feature.

### Schema-v1 persistence (`src/persistence`)
- The three-tier Firestore layout is a contract: `projects/{projectId}` metadata, `projects/{projectId}/song/current`, `projects/{projectId}/clips/{clipId}`, and `projects/{projectId}/arrangement/{trackId}` chunks when the song document exceeds its budget. See [`docs/persistence.md`](./docs/persistence.md).
- `src/persistence/documents.ts` owns every collection path and document body. No other module builds a Firestore path or document for a project.
- Every write is revision-checked and every tier is written independently: a note edit writes one clip document, never song structure.
- `ProjectRepository` has an in-memory and a Firestore implementation, and both run the same contract suite. Only `firestoreProjectRepository.ts` imports `firebase/firestore`, so it is not re-exported from the directory barrel.
- Autosave (`autosave.ts`) coalesces rapid edits, exposes save state, keeps a failed write queued for retry, and ignores remote echoes at or below the local revision.

### Shared command layer (`src/commands`)
- Every project mutation — pointer, keyboard, or assistant — is a registered command. Components never write to project state; they build a typed command and hand it to `CommandHistory`.
- A command declares a versioned type, a Zod payload schema, a pure `apply`, a generated `invert`, and a one-line `summarize`. Payloads carry explicit IDs for anything they create, so replay, redo, and assistant previews reproduce the same project.
- `executeTransaction` is the atomic unit: commands apply to a working copy, the result is checked against every domain invariant, and any failure returns the original project object untouched. One committed transaction produces exactly one revision and one history entry.
- Continuous gestures use `history.beginGesture()`; every step applies immediately but the whole drag commits as one entry and one revision.
- Undo/redo is session-local, bounded, and replays inverse commands rather than project snapshots. Only an explicit `replaceProject` clears it — a save acknowledgement or remote echo must never touch it.
- Like `src/domain`, this layer imports no Firebase, Tone, or Solid. Adding or changing a command is a contract change; see the registry test's pinned command list.

### Audio engine (`src/audio`)
- `AudioRuntime` is the single application-scoped owner of the real-time Tone/Web Audio context, transport, buffer cache, and resource registry. It is the only place production code may create, install, resume, suspend, replace, or close that context — obtain it via `getAudioRuntime()`, never construct one directly.
- `ProjectAudioGraph` reconciles a read-only `AudioSongProjection` (from `src/projection/audioProjection.ts`) into a stable graph keyed by track, instrument, device, return, and asset IDs. Passing back the exact projection object the audio projection handed out previously is a complete no-op; an edit to one track, return, or placement only touches that entity's own subgraph.
- `TrackAudioGraph`/`ReturnAudioGraph`/`MasterAudioGraph` each own one channel strip (`Tone.PanVol`/`Tone.Volume`) plus a `DeviceChain`. `DeviceChain` reconciles an ordered `Device[]` by id: only added/removed devices create or dispose a node, and reordering relinks connections without recreating anything. Schema v1 has no concrete processors yet (Alpha Milestone 1 authors them); an unregistered `device.type` gets an inert passthrough node so topology is provable ahead of real DSP.
- `InstrumentGraph.ts` builds the sampler/synth/drum-machine node for a track's `Instrument`. A track only replaces its instrument node when `kind` changes; an asset swap, a drum-pad added/removed, or a generic parameter edit calls the existing node's `update()` instead. The module itself is just the `kind` dispatcher and the public surface (`InstrumentNode`, `InstrumentGraphContext`, `InstrumentNodeFactory`, `createInstrumentNode`, `playOneShot`) — consumers import it and nothing else. Each instrument's implementation lives in its own module under `src/audio/instruments/`, over the shared types in `instruments/types.ts` and the asset-subscription helpers in `instruments/assetVoice.ts`.
- `AudioBufferCache` decodes and caches asset buffers keyed by asset ID and content fingerprint, with reference-counted eviction and generation-tracked cancellation so a stale decode can never reconnect or overwrite a newer one. It never imports Tone itself — `toneBufferLoader.ts` is the one production loader that does, which keeps the cache's generation/refcount bookkeeping testable without any Web Audio globals.
- `Transport.ts` owns the session-scoped playhead: play/pause/stop/seek/continue, the 40-240 BPM clamp, a bar-aligned loop range, and the metronome. It is written against an injectable `TransportEngine` rather than `Tone.getTransport()`, and it never schedules the arrangement — a tempo change is mirrored onto the transport, not applied by rebuilding nodes. Tempo lives in the song and is written only by a `parameter.set` command; this layer mirrors it. `underrun.ts` counts late dispatches and reports them *sampled* as `audio_underrun`; it compares an event's intended time against `ProjectAudioGraph.audioClockNow()` (the context's true `currentTime`), never `Tone.now()`, which is `currentTime + lookAhead` and would score healthy playback as a continuous stream of drops.
- `audioLoopPlayer.ts` plays one scheduled audio-loop event. A loop declares the tempo it was authored at, and it follows the song tempo by *time-stretching*, not resampling: `Tone.GrainPlayer` walks the buffer at `tempo / sourceTempo` while each grain sounds at its native rate, so the loop's pitch stays where it was recorded. At an unstretched rate of 1 it falls back to a plain `Tone.Player`, so a loop at its own tempo pays no granular cost at all. `audioLoopOffsetSeconds` is a position in the *buffer's* timeline and `audioLoopDurationSeconds` a span of the *song's* — the two only coincide at rate 1, and mixing them up is what silently truncates or overruns a stretched loop.
- `scheduling.ts` expands a placement's clip content into absolute-tick events (looping and clip trimming included) as a pure function of the audio projection; `ProjectAudioGraph` schedules those against `Tone.Transport` (or an injected `AudioTransport` in tests) with an owner-tracked handle per event, never an anonymous global callback.
- Every constructed Tone/Web Audio resource is registered with the owning `AudioProjectScope` (`AudioRuntime.openProjectScope`) so disposal is idempotent and instrumented — components and domain stores request graph operations but never receive mutable audio nodes.
- [`docs/audio-graphs.html`](./docs/audio-graphs.html) draws every instrument, device and strip graph as nodes and connections. It is hand-kept, not generated: a change to how `src/audio` builds or wires nodes updates the matching entry in its `GRAPHS` list in the same PR (the comment at the top of the page explains the format).
- `src/editor/useProjectAudio.ts` is the one place a component wires a `Project` onto `ProjectAudioGraph`: it rebuilds the `AudioSongProjection` (passing the previous one through, so an unrelated edit reuses unchanged entries) on every project change, and its `play()` is the allowed user gesture that resumes the shared `AudioRuntime` context. The prototype `SongPlayer`/`ToneInstrument`/`AudioProvider.tsx` playback path this superseded was removed by `FND-009`; do not reintroduce a component-owned Tone lifecycle.

### Shortcut registry (`src/shortcuts`)
- `src/shortcuts/registry.ts` is the only place a key combination is written down ([`docs/shortcuts.md`](./docs/shortcuts.md) is its human copy). Event handling, tooltips, menu labels, the `?` guide, the `shortcut_used` analytics `action_id` set, and [`docs/shortcuts.md`](./docs/shortcuts.md) are all derived from it; a component never compares `event.key` itself and never adds its own `keydown` listener — modals included, which register `view.close_surface` for `Escape` (see `src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`) rather than owning a per-modal listener.
- An entry declares action ID, per-platform keys, valid contexts, guide group, and whether it follows or intentionally differs from Ableton Live. Enabled state is not in the registry — the surface that owns the action supplies a handler with an optional `isEnabled()`, and an action with no handler simply does not fire.
- `ShortcutController` is framework-free and owns every dispatch rule: `global` is always active, `dialog` suppresses every other context, typing targets keep their keys (only `Escape` is marked `textEntry: "allowed"`), auto-repeat is ignored unless the mapping opts in, and a disabled or unhandled action leaves the browser default alone. `useShortcuts` is the thin Solid adapter that installs it on the window.
- Matching reads `KeyboardEvent.key`, never `code`, and ignores the Shift modifier for punctuation, so `?` and `+` work on any keyboard layout.
- `ShortcutController` logs `shortcut_used` with the matched entry's own `action_id`; handlers never log analytics. Adding a mapping means adding its ID to `SHORTCUT_ACTION_IDS` in both the registry and `src/analytics/catalog.ts`, or `catalog.test.ts` fails.
- Adding a shortcut also means updating `docs/shortcuts.md` — `src/shortcuts/docs.test.ts` fails if the two drift.

### The palette (`src/theme.css`)
- **Read [`docs/design.md`](./docs/design.md) before changing how anything looks**: square corners, a monochrome palette with colour kept for meaning, clearly organised sections, and one shared set of parts.
- The faceplate design the instrument, device and mixer surfaces follow (#447) is [`docs/faceplate-system.html`](./docs/faceplate-system.html), a self-contained page that plays. It is the reference for layout, parts and states; `src/theme.css` stays the authority for colour.
- The Post-Alpha instruments (synth #940, wavetable #944, FM #945, drum synth #989, sampler #122/#943) follow [`docs/instrument-faceplates.html`](./docs/instrument-faceplates.html), a playable study in the faceplate system: every section stacks heading, well, switch and faders so each row lines up across the instrument; sections share one set of names and follow the signal (oscillators, filter, voice, amp envelope, filter or mod envelope, LFO); the header carries Randomize, the preset picker and Audition on its right. Its sounds and presets are stand-ins; its layout, parts and names are the reference.
- The library modal (#449) follows [`docs/library-browser.html`](./docs/library-browser.html), a playable walkthrough of finding, filtering, similar sounds, browsing packs, the library-only keys and inserting. Its data and synthesized sounds are stand-ins; its layout, parts and flow are the reference.
- The Export dialog (#724) follows the **Release** tab of [`docs/export-dialog.html`](./docs/export-dialog.html), a clickable prototype: the song leads, the stems track list is the mini-arrangement's name column (click, ⇧-click range, ⌘-click pick), stems over 2 GiB download as batched ZIPs, and a finished export celebrates in the tracks' own colours. Its data and render timings are stand-ins; its layout, parts, copy and states are the reference. The other two tabs are the alternatives it was chosen over.
- `src/theme.css` is the only place a colour is written down. It holds custom properties and nothing else, so a static page (`docs/architecture.html`) can link it without dragging the app's base styles along. `src/app.css` `@import`s it, and Vite inlines that at build time.
- **The interface is literally monochrome: every token is a neutral grey with R, G and B equal.** No tinted greys, no coloured accent, no coloured status. Black and white are the anchors; the ramp between them (`--mono-00` … `--mono-100`) is nine steps, each with exactly one job, and mid-greys are what it spends least.
- **State is brightness, not hue.** Selected, focused, active and playing are the brightest thing in their neighbourhood — usually a white fill with `--color-on-accent` (black) on it. `--color-accent-dim` and `--color-accent-deep` are the steps below for a fill under the pointer and for material that is present but not chosen.
- **The one exception is the selected track, which is black** (#447, a product-owner decision): the track the editor is showing sinks to `--color-background` wherever tracks are listed, the arrangement's header, the instrument rail, the mixer strip, and the selected drum pad's row with them, so the selection reads as a hole in the panel while pressed toggles and chosen options stay white.
- Status is monochrome too, so an error signals through emphasis and framing (`--color-danger-wash`/`-edge`) and through its wording — not through being red. A destructive action is a white fill with black on it, the loudest control on screen. If a pairing puts a bright fill under bright text, that is a bug: check the `color` beside every `background`.
- **The level meters' clip state is the one status in colour** (#447): a meter fills `--signal-ok` (green) while its track peaks under 0 dBFS and `--signal-clip` (red) for a moment after a peak goes over (`src/editor/trackLevels.ts`). Its bar is the RMS; only peaks can say a track clipped. The pair is a product-owner decision, only `LevelMeter.css` may read it, and `theme.test.ts` pins both halves.
- **A track's own colour is the other hue in the product, and it is not theme** — it is persisted domain data (`TRACK_COLORS` in `src/domain/factories.ts`), so changing it is a schema change. Against a colourless interface it is unmissable, which is the point.
- Style against a **semantic alias** (`--color-background-secondary`, `--color-text`, `--color-accent`), not a ramp step. The ramp is the vocabulary; only the aliases survive a re-theme. Never introduce a near-duplicate of a step that already exists, and never a local alias for a token that already says the same thing.
- `src/theme.test.ts` enforces all of it: a colour literal in any other stylesheet, a token read but never defined, a token whose channels are not all equal, a tint borrowing anything but black or white, a tenth ramp step, or an arrangement-canvas fallback that has drifted from the theme each fail there.
- A canvas cannot read a custom property, so `src/arrangement/canvasRenderer.ts` resolves the tokens off the document once and caches them; its literals are fallbacks for a context with no stylesheet (jsdom), pinned to the theme by that test.

### Service Layer
- Create service modules for external integrations (authService, dataService)
- Services handle all direct Firebase API calls
- Services provide clean, typed interfaces to the rest of the app

### Real-time Synchronization
- Use Firestore's `onSnapshot` for real-time updates
- Subscriptions are set up in the apply half of a `createEffect`, and their teardown is what that half returns
- Store updates mutate the draft the setter hands them; `produce` is gone, and draft mutation is the default

### Routing
- **There is no file-based routing.** `<FileRoutes />` came from `@solidjs/start/router`, and SolidStart has no Solid 2 release. Router 2 does ship a `fileRoutes()` adapter in `@solidjs/router/fs`, but it reads a `virtual:file-routes` manifest that `@solidjs/vite-plugin` does not emit, so there is nothing for it to consume
- Routes are an explicit table in `src/router.tsx`: a path and a `lazy()` page module per entry. Every page stays `lazy` — **except `/`**, which is eager because it is prerendered into the shell and its stylesheet has to be in the entry graph for that markup to paint styled (ADR 0008)
- Page modules live in `src/routes/`, but their filenames are only names — the `[param]`/`[...404]` spelling is gone, because nothing reads it. The patterns live in the table
- Use `useParams()` from `@solidjs/router` to read route parameters. Router 2 types them as `string | undefined`; narrow with `Show` rather than asserting (see `src/routes/projects/Project.tsx`)

## Testing

- Test files use `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Vitest configured with jsdom for DOM testing
- Use `@solidjs/testing-library` for component tests
- Use `@testing-library/jest-dom` for DOM assertions
- Beyond unit/component tests, the project has a Firebase Emulator suite (`tests/emulator/`, `bun run test:emulator`) and a Playwright browser E2E suite against a local Firestore/Auth emulator (`tests/e2e/emulator/`, `bun run test:browser:emulator`) — see [`docs/testing.md`](./docs/testing.md) for what each covers and how CI gates on them. The in-memory mock backend (`bun run dev:mock`) is a development backend only; no browser suite runs against it
- Use `src/shared/id.ts`'s `createId`/`createSeededIdFactory` for entity IDs and `src/shared/clock.ts`'s `Clock` for anything that needs the current time, rather than calling `nanoid()`/`Date.now()` directly, so tests can be deterministic
- Use `src/testing/fixtures.ts`'s builders (`buildProject`, `buildTrack`, ...) instead of hand-writing fixture literals in new tests

### `bun run test` needs an audio output device

Importing `tone` creates a real global `AudioContext`, and `node-web-audio-api`'s `cpal` backend refuses to create one on a host with no default output device (containers, CI runners, headless VMs), so any suite that reaches Tone fails at import time with `InvalidStateError: cpal backend error during default_output_config: DeviceUnavailable`.

That is an environment problem, not a test bug — **do not "fix" it by mocking Tone, skipping the file, or editing `src/audio/testAudioContext.ts`.** Set up a null ALSA device instead; [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md#a-null-alsa-device-on-machines-with-no-audio-hardware) has the exact steps.

**It applies to `bun run test` only — not the browser suites.** A real browser constructs a context regardless: Firefox reports `state="suspended"` on a runner with no `/dev/snd` at all. So if a *browser* test fails around audio, a null ALSA device will not help and its absence is not the cause — this exact wrong turn has already cost a CI round. See [`docs/testing.md`](./docs/testing.md#playback-is-asserted-in-chromium-only--a-known-tracked-gap), and `LOOP-003` (#43) for the product-side gap behind it.

## Important Configuration Notes

1. **The app runs client-side only** - `solid({ start: true })` with no `ssr` in `vite.config.ts` is the plugin's **client start mode**. `vite build` emits a static `dist/client` whose `index.html` is the shell prerendered once through the built handler, and the client `render()`s (never hydrates) into it. The app itself never renders on the server, which is the PRD's client-only decision unchanged.

   That shell is **not empty**: `src/Document.tsx` renders the landing page's markup and metadata into it, so `/` is indexable, unfurls, and paints with JavaScript disabled (ADR 0008). Only the document goes through the SSR transforms — the app does not. Because the generated entry renders `<Document />` with no request, the shell cannot be path-aware, so `scripts/emit-app-shell.mjs` writes a stripped `app.html` after the build and `firebase.json` serves `/` from `index.html` and every other path from `app.html`; the dev server and `vite preview` serve one shell and an inline script removes the markup during parse. `bun run verify:landing-static` gates both halves. A landing-only tag added to the document **must** carry `data-landing="true"` or it ships on every deep link
2. **Module system** - Using ESNext with bundler resolution
3. **JSX** - Preserved with `@solidjs/web` as the import source (`tsconfig.json`'s `jsxImportSource`)
4. **Strict TypeScript** - All strict checks enabled
5. **Package Management** - This project uses Bun as the package manager
   - **NEVER commit package-lock.json** - This file is auto-generated by npm and conflicts with Bun's package management
   - Use `bun install` for installing dependencies, not `npm install`
   - package-lock.json is in .gitignore and should remain there

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new route
1. Create the page module in `src/routes/`, with the component as its default export
2. Add its path to the `routes` table in `src/router.tsx`, wrapping the import in `lazy()` so it stays its own chunk. The filename does not define the route — the table does
3. It is served the `app.html` shell, not the prerendered landing document, so it renders entirely on the client

### Adding a new data model
1. Define the entity's shape and Zod schema in `src/domain/entities.ts`, and add any invariants it needs to `src/domain/parse.ts`
2. Add a factory in `src/domain/factories.ts` and cover it in `src/domain/fixtures.ts` if other tests will need it
3. Add or extend the commands that create/mutate it in `src/commands/definitions/`, registered in `src/commands/registry.ts`
4. Extend `src/persistence/documents.ts` if it changes what a Firestore document stores

### Adding a new component
1. Create in appropriate directory under `src/components/`
2. Keep focused on single responsibility
3. Extract complex logic to separate functions
4. Use TypeScript for props

### Working with audio
1. Use `useProjectAudio()` (`src/editor/useProjectAudio.ts`) to wire a project onto playback from a component
2. All Tone.js code should be in `src/audio/`
3. Keep audio logic separate from UI components

### Referencing a factory sound
1. Never write an asset name, storage path, duration, sample rate, or channel count into `src/` — those are the library's facts, and `CNT-001` removed the last hand-maintained copy of them
2. Ask `src/library/factoryLibrary.ts` (`factoryLibraryEntry`, `createFactoryAsset`) instead; it reads `factoryLibrary.generated.ts`, which `bun run library:emit-runtime` produces from the same builders that emit the delivered pack manifests
3. To ship a different starter sound, change `RUNTIME_SELECTION` in `scripts/starter-library/runtime.mjs` and re-run the command — the committed module is drift-checked by `scripts/starter-library/runtime.test.mjs`
4. Browsing the rest of the library fetches the pack index and then a pack manifest (sample-library section 12); it is not bundled
