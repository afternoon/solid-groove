# Groove

So many people want to make music, but learning music production is hard. Letâ€™s make it easier.

The music production tool of the future:

- Is easy to use, with a simple, intuitive interface
- Runs in a browser so you can get started quickly
- Tightly integrates AI, like having your favourite producer right there next to you
- Generates new ideas that you can build on
- Has a library of sounds and other elements
- Is collaborative, so you can work on projects with friends

Let's build it!
