| Decides | Which parts of a user's project may be sent to the AI provider, and the disclosure copy that describes it |
| Supersedes | The draft disclosure copy in `AI-006` ([#95](https://github.com/afternoon/solid-groove/issues/95)), including its "no notes, no project contents beyond the project ID" claim |
| Affects | `DEC-005` ([#34](https://github.com/afternoon/solid-groove/issues/34)), `AI-006` ([#95](https://github.com/afternoon/solid-groove/issues/95)), `AI-001` ([#69](https://github.com/afternoon/solid-groove/issues/69)), `src/projection/assistantContextProjection.ts`, `src/projection/projectAnalysisProjection.ts` |

## Context

[ADR 0006](./0006-anthropic-behind-a-model-agnostic-gateway.md) settles which provider the assistant calls and what it may cost. This one settles what we hand that provider, and what we say about it.

Two terms were already recorded on `DEC-005` and are inherited here rather than reopened: assistant transcripts are retained first-party for **30 days**, and the alpha ships **no provider-level opt-out** — a user who does not want their prompts reaching the provider declines the assistant, which costs no manual DAW capability.

The projections that would carry the payload already exist. `assistantContextProjection.ts` sends the project name, tempo, time signature, track and section names, instrument kinds, device and clip counts, mixer state and the current selection; `projectAnalysisProjection.ts` adds derived facts — pitch range, mean velocity, notes per bar, repetition ratio. **Neither sends a single note event.** That gap is not a detail: an assistant that can "add, remove, move, resize, and transform note events" cannot do any of it to material it has never seen. As built, the most-used half of the assistant's capability set was undeliverable.

[ADR 0003](./0003-replay-canvas-capture-and-assistant-conversation-retention.md) decision 5 established the standard this decision is held to: when a disclosure's promise stops being true, the copy is corrected rather than defended. That is what happens below.

## Decision

### 1. The off-platform payload is an allowlist

The assistant may be sent, for the project currently open:

- project name, tempo, time signature, total length;
- sections, with their names, positions and lengths;
- tracks, with their names, type, instrument kind, device/clip/placement counts, and mixer state;
- derived note statistics — register, mean velocity, density, repetition;
- a description of the current selection;
- **raw note events for the current selection only**;
- the conversation so far, within the bound [ADR 0006](./0006-anthropic-behind-a-model-agnostic-gateway.md) decision 3 sets.

Anything not on this list is not sent. Extending the list is a change to this ADR.

### 2. What never leaves, regardless

Audio of any kind. Note events outside the current selection. Asset URLs. Provider credentials or tokens. Account data beyond the pseudonymous identifier quota enforcement needs — no email address, no display name.

### 3. Raw notes are scoped to the selection, and that is what makes the capability deliverable

Sending the selection's notes is what lets the assistant edit notes at all. Scoping it to the selection is what keeps the exposure proportional: the material the user is actively working on goes, the rest of the project does not, and the payload does not grow without bound as the project does.

Where the user has selected nothing, the assistant receives the song-level summary and no note events, and says it lacks the context rather than inventing it.

### 4. User-entered names leave the platform, deliberately

Project, track and section names are free text a user typed, and they go to the provider verbatim. An assistant that cannot say "I turned the bass down" — only "I turned track_7f3a down" — is visibly worse at the one thing it is for.

This is a real cost and it is accepted rather than mitigated: a track named for a person, a label, or an unreleased collaboration goes off-platform along with everything else. What the decision requires instead is that the disclosure say so plainly, which the copy below does. Silently sending names while implying we do not is the outcome this rejects.

### 5. The disclosure copy is approved as follows

> **About the assistant**
>
> Solid Groove sends Anthropic — the AI service behind the assistant — your message along with a description of the project you're working in: its name, your track and section names, the tempo and structure, your mixer settings, and the notes in whatever you currently have selected. It does not send your audio, and it does not send the rest of your project.
>
> *[One sentence stating Anthropic's actual retention and training posture, written from their published terms on the day this ships.]*
>
> Separately, Solid Groove keeps your conversations — your messages, the assistant's replies, and the changes it proposes, including any notes it writes for you — for 30 days. Our goal is to make the assistant better. The team may read them. After 30 days they are deleted.
>
> ☑ Keep my conversations with the assistant for 30 days
> This controls Solid Groove's own copy only. It does not take back anything already sent to Anthropic.
>
> The assistant behaves exactly the same either way, and every other part of Solid Groove works without it — if you would rather nothing was sent, you can simply not use the assistant.

Wording stays tweakable without reopening this ADR; what may not change is that it remains true and specific about the same four things — what is sent, what the provider may do with it, what we keep and for how long, and what the control does and does not cover.

### 6. The provider-posture sentence is written from verified terms, and shipping it unverified is a defect

`AI-006` reads Anthropic's published terms on the day it ships, writes that one sentence from what they actually say, and cites what it read in its PR. Shipping the bracketed placeholder is a defect; so is shipping a posture claim nobody checked.

`DEC-005` recorded a *permission* — that the provider may retain and train on our requests — and permission is not knowledge. If the terms say Anthropic does not train on API traffic, then telling the cohort it might would be a false statement in the frightening direction, which fails ADR 0003 decision 5's standard exactly as a reassuring falsehood would.

### 7. The `AI-006` draft copy's central claim is withdrawn

That draft told the user "Your music itself is not kept: no audio, no notes, and no clip or project contents beyond the ID of the project you were working in." It is false twice over. It is false about what is sent, under decisions 1 and 4. And it is false about our own store: `AI-006`'s record holds the proposals the assistant showed, and a proposal that writes a bassline **is** note data. The claim would have become untrue the first time the assistant did the thing it exists to do.

### 8. The opt-out's scope limit renders on the control, in both places it appears

The line stating that the control governs Solid Groove's copy only travels with the control itself — in the first-run dialog and in the durable settings surface, which is where most users will meet it on day three rather than day one. A true statement that only appears where a skimming user will not read it is doing the work of a misleading one.

## Consequences

### What this buys

- The assistant can edit notes, which the assistant's alpha capability set assumed and the projections did not support.
- The exposure is bounded by something specific — an allowlist and a selection — rather than by "we send a summary."
- The disclosure describes what actually happens, including the parts that are not flattering, so the first cohort member who thinks about it does not find a gap between the copy and the payload.

### What this costs, and what we do about it

- **User-typed names reach a third party that may retain them.** No mitigation removes this; decision 4 accepts it and decision 5 discloses it. The alternative was an assistant that cannot name anything.
- **The payload grows with the selection.** Selecting an entire dense track sends every note in it. Bounded in practice by what a user can select and by [ADR 0006](./0006-anthropic-behind-a-model-agnostic-gateway.md) decision 3's history bound, but it is not a fixed ceiling.
- **The disclosure is longer than the draft it replaces.** Being specific about four things costs words, and a dialog people skim is a poor place to spend them. Decision 8 is the partial answer: the load-bearing sentence sits on the control.
- **One sentence of the copy cannot be written until someone reads the provider's terms**, which makes `AI-006` depend on an external document that can change under it.
- **The projections need extending**, and the note-event path needs its own test that nothing outside the selection is ever included.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Stats and names only, no raw notes | Exactly what ships today, and it makes the assistant's note editing undeliverable. The gap would have surfaced as a failed acceptance criterion late in the milestone rather than as a decision made in the open |
| Send the whole project's notes every turn | Best assistant quality; the payload grows without bound as the project does, and the material a user is not working on has no reason to leave |
| Strip user-entered names, send IDs only | Nothing a user typed leaves, and the assistant can no longer refer to anything by name. Degrades every single reply to protect a case that the disclosure can honestly describe instead |
| Keep the `AI-006` draft copy and its "no notes" line | It is false under decisions 1 and 4, and false about our own transcript store. ADR 0003 decision 5 settled that the copy gets corrected |
| Keep the conservative "may retain and train" line unverified | Ships without an external dependency, at the price of possibly telling the cohort something untrue. A frightening falsehood is not the safe end of the error bar |
| Add a provider-level opt-out now | Already deferred on `DEC-005` as `P2-005`, with `HARD-005` asking the cohort about it directly. Unparking it is that decision's to make, not this one's |

## Revisit when

- A user can import their own samples, at which point asset names stop being library facts we ship and become user content, exactly as [ADR 0003](./0003-replay-canvas-capture-and-assistant-conversation-retention.md) flagged for replay.
- `HARD-005` reports that the cohort does care about provider-level opt-out, which unparks `P2-005` and changes what the copy has to offer.
- Anthropic's published terms change, which changes decision 6's sentence and may change decision 1's calculus.
- The assistant needs project-wide note context to do something it cannot do scoped to the selection — a real finding, not a convenience, and it reopens decision 3.
- Public launch, where a larger and uninvited audience changes the privacy calculus for names.
