# Core flows

A **core flow** is one user journey that must work end to end when a feature is
finished, written in plain English before any code exists. It is the durable QA
record: the thing a reviewer walks through on a preview channel, and the thing an
automated test reproduces on every push.

This file is the register of those flows. Each one has a stable ID (`CF-001`,
`CF-002`, …) that an issue links to, an E2E spec is named after, and a screenshot
walkthrough is captured from. Those three artefacts are traceably one thing
because they all carry the same ID.

## What a core flow is, and is not

A core flow **is** a journey a person takes through the product, from an
entrypoint they could actually arrive at, to an outcome they can see. It is
written so that someone who has never read the code can follow it by hand.

A core flow is **not**:

- a product principle (that is the PRD's job),
- an acceptance criterion (that is the issue's job),
- a unit of implementation (that is the PR's job), or
- an exhaustive test plan. A flow covers the path that must not break, not every
  branch off it. Edge cases, failure states, and empty states are still tested at
  the lowest useful layer, as they always were.

Most features need one or two flows. A feature that seems to need six probably
contains a dependency that should be its own issue.

## Precedence

A registered flow **is** the specification of the behavior it describes. Nothing
else states it: [`docs/prd.md`](./prd.md) holds the product's principles — vision,
target user, goals and non-goals, sample licensing, privacy — and no longer
specifies features, and an issue says what to build for one task rather than what
the product does.

So a flow answers to two things above it. It must not contradict a **product
principle** in the PRD — a flow that requires the product to behave against its
own principles is wrong, and the principle wins. And where a flow and an issue
disagree about the same behavior, the flow wins: it is the frozen contract the
implementation is measured against, and an issue that needs different behavior
changes the flow in the same PR, and says so.

## Who edits this file

The product owner, and the agent shipping a feature that adds a journey worth
guarding (see `CLAUDE.md`, "Core flows"). A flow describes behaviour the product
owner agreed while shaping the issue; it is never written to match whatever was
built.

- An existing flow's assertions are not weakened to fit an implementation. When a
  feature genuinely changes a journey, the PR that changes the flow says what
  changed and why.
- A flow that is ambiguous, impossible, or contradicted by a product principle
  in the PRD is raised on the issue, not quietly edited.

`docs/prd.md` is the product owner's alone.

## Lifecycle of a flow

1. **Specified.** The feature's first PR, its own and landed before the
   implementation, adds the entry here with a fresh ID and `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/<ID>.spec.ts`, marked `test.fixme`
   because the implementation does not exist yet. It merges green, because a
   `fixme` test does not fail.
2. **Live.** The PR that completes the feature removes the `test.fixme` in the
   same diff that makes it pass.

`bun run verify:core-flows` enforces the 1:1 mapping between the IDs in this file
and the spec files, and reports any flow still parked at `fixme` so a feature cannot
quietly land with its flow permanently skipped.

## Which suite a flow belongs in

**`tests/e2e/emulator/flows/`, and nowhere else.** Every core flow runs against
a real (emulated) Firestore and Auth.

There is no choice to make here, and that is deliberate. A journey is not
finished when the screen looks right — it is finished when the producer comes
back tomorrow and their work is still there. So **persistence is part of every
flow's outcome**, and every flow ends by reloading the page and finding what it
made. The in-memory mock backend cannot answer that: it is a fresh, empty store
on every page load, so a reload there proves the opposite of what a flow needs
to claim.

A browser test of a single surface that is not a journey lives in the same
suite, beside the flows: `tests/e2e/emulator/*.spec.ts`. (The mock-backend
browser suite that used to hold those was retired.) `bun run verify:core-flows`
enforces the flows' single location, and `bun run walkthrough:capture` captures
from it.

See [`docs/testing.md`](./testing.md) for what each suite covers and how CI gates
on them.

## Anatomy of a flow

Copy this shape. Keep the steps in the second person and free of selectors, CSS
classes, and function names — if a step cannot be followed by a person with a
browser, it is written at the wrong altitude.

```markdown
### CF-0NN — Short title in the user's language

**Issue:** #NN · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-0NN.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the public landing page

**Preconditions:** what must already be true. "None" is a good answer.

1. A step you can perform.
2. Another step.
3. The step that produces the outcome.

**Outcome:** what you can now see, hear, or do that you could not before.

**Out of scope:** the neighbouring things this flow deliberately does not prove,
so nobody reads its passing as coverage of them.
```

The **entrypoint** matters: a flow starts where a person would actually arrive —
the public landing page, the project dashboard, or a project page — not at a deep
link with seeded state. That is what makes the captured walkthrough worth looking
at, and it is why a walkthrough is a byproduct of the flow test rather than a
separate errand.

## Flows

**"Signed in" means an invited producer (#854).** The alpha is invite-only:
guest start is retired, and only a Google address on the alpha allowlist can sign
in. So a flow whose precondition is "signed in" starts signed in to a fresh,
allowlisted Google account with nothing in it, and its spec gets there through
`tests/e2e/emulator/support/test.ts` rather than by signing in. Signing in
itself is CF-001's journey, and being refused is CF-032's.

### CF-001 — An invited producer signs in and reaches a playing loop

**Issue:** #854 for this revision (the flow itself pre-dates the register and
described shipped `FND-009`/`LOOP-010` behavior; #304, #496 and #817 revised the
editor it walks through) · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-001.spec.ts` ·
**Entrypoint:** the public landing page

**Rewritten for the alpha allowlist (#854).** This flow used to start with no
account at all: "Start in your browser" made the visitor a guest. Guest start is
retired and only an invited Google address can sign in, so steps 2 and 3 are now
signing in from the landing page and arriving signed in. From creating a project
onwards the journey is the one it always was: edit the starter pattern and hear
it. Parked at `test.fixme` until #854's stack lands.

**Revised for onboarding (GRV-25).** A new account now meets Cue at the welcome
before the dashboard, so step 3 passes through it with Skip to the studio. The
welcome itself is CF-035's subject.

**Preconditions:** you have been invited: your Google address is on the alpha
list. You have no projects.

1. Open the landing page.
2. Choose Sign in, and sign in with Google as the invited address.
3. You arrive signed in at the welcome, where Cue introduces itself. Choose
   Skip to the studio: you are on the dashboard, with no projects yet.
4. Create a new project.
5. The project opens on the arrangement, with a four-on-the-floor starter
   pattern sitting on its only track, a drum machine named "BD".
6. Open that clip. The sequence view fills the page, showing the pattern on the
   "BD" pad: steps 1, 5, 9 and 13 on.
7. Turn on a step that was off on the "BD" pad, and press 1 to go back to the
   arrangement.
8. Start playback.

**Outcome:** an invited producer who arrived at the front door is signed in and
listening to a loop they just edited, and the transport shows it is running.

**Out of scope:** that the loop is *audible*. A headless browser records no audio
and Playwright captures none, so this flow proves the transport starts, not that
a sound reached a speaker. Playback is asserted in Chromium only — see
[`docs/testing.md`](./testing.md#playback-is-asserted-in-chromium-only--a-known-tracked-gap)
and issue #43. Being refused, which is CF-032's subject. Moving between the five
views, which is CF-008's subject: this flow only ever sees the arrangement and
the sequence view. And persistence — it never reloads, and CF-004 onwards are
where coming back to your work is proved.

### CF-002 — A producer builds a five-part loop

**Issue:** #61, trimmed for #817 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-002.spec.ts` ·
**Entrypoint:** the project dashboard

**Trimmed for #817.** This flow used to go on to turn the loop into a song
outline: select the loop, apply a structure template, delete the drums from the
Intro, play from the top, undo twice. That was #61 (ARR-003), and the requirement
was dropped when #61 closed, so those steps are gone. What remains is the part
that guards real surfaces: building a loop across drum machines and samplers,
through the sequence and Library views, and finding it again after a reload.

**Revised for #496.** The drum parts are drum-machine tracks sequenced on the
step grid by pad; the pitched parts (chord stab, bass) are sampler tracks
written in the piano roll, where C4 plays the sample as recorded.

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** A clip is sequenced in the
sequence view and a sound is loaded in the Library view, so "from the library"
in steps 4-5 means pressing the sampler's sample slot, inserting there, and
coming back.

**Preconditions:** signed in, as an invited producer, with no projects — where
CF-001 ends. (Revised for #854: this was "signed in as a guest" until guest start
was retired.)

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement with the starter kick, a
   drum machine named "BD", four on the floor.
2. Add a drum-machine track named "Hats", and put the "HH" pad on every offbeat.
3. Add a drum-machine track named "Claps", with the "CP" pad on beats 2 and 4.
4. Add a sampler track named "Chords", load a chord stab onto it from the
   library, and write a C4 in the piano roll on steps 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16.
5. Add a sampler track named "Bass", load a bass note onto it from the library,
   and write a C4 in the piano roll following the kick, on steps 1, 5, 9 and 13.
6. Play the loop — five parts, one bar, tight.
7. Reload the page. The five tracks are still there, in the order you added
   them.

**Outcome:** a producer built a five-part loop out of drum machines and
samplers, heard it play, and found it intact when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that any of it is *audible* — as in CF-001, a headless browser
records no audio, so this proves the transport runs, not that a sound reached a
speaker. Turning the loop into a song, which was dropped with #61. Each part's
own editing beyond the steps written here, which CF-017 to CF-020 cover.

### CF-003 — A producer names and rearranges the parts of their song

**Issue:** #61 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-003.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in, as an invited producer, with no projects. (Revised
for #854: this was "signed in as a guest" until guest start was retired.)

1. Create a new project and duplicate its placement further along the timeline,
   so there are two distinct parts to label.
2. Add a section over the first part and name it "Intro".
3. Add a section over the second part, name it "Drop", and give it a different
   colour.
4. Move "Drop" ahead of "Intro".
5. The two sections swap places on the ruler, and the placements inside each one
   travel with it.
6. Undo once.

**Outcome:** the producer has labelled the parts of their song and reordered one,
its clips moving with it, and a single undo puts the order back.

**Out of scope:** the template-driven path, which is CF-002; section-aware
automation (`ARR-004`); and whether sections survive a reload, which would belong
to a flow in `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/`.

### CF-004 — A producer sets the span they are working in

**Issue:** #280 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-004.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. Above the tracks, the ruler carries a loop brace spanning
   the first bar, and looping is on.
2. Start playback. The playhead runs to the end of bar 1 and jumps back to the
   start, over and over.
3. Drag the right-hand edge of the brace out to the end of bar 2.
4. The brace now spans two bars. Playback never stopped, and the playhead now
   turns around at the end of bar 2.
5. Switch looping off. The playhead runs past the end of the brace and keeps
   going; the brace stays where it is.
6. Switch looping back on, stop, and reload the page.
7. The project reopens with the brace still spanning bars 1 and 2, and looping
   still on.

**Outcome:** the producer chose the span they are working inside, changed it
without interrupting playback, and found it exactly as they left it when they
came back.

**Out of scope:** that any of it is *audible* — a headless browser records no
audio, so this proves the playhead and the transport, not that a sound reached a
speaker (see [`docs/testing.md`](./testing.md#playback-is-asserted-in-chromium-only--a-known-tracked-gap)
and issue #43). It also does not prove that anything else in the product moves
the brace: nothing does, deliberately, and CF-005 is where that is asserted from
the other side.

### CF-005 — A producer brings a library loop into their project

**Issue:** #281 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-005.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Retitled and rewritten by #304**, which makes the library a modal opened from a
slot rather than a panel standing open beside the arrangement. The journey is
unchanged — a loop out of the library lands on a new track at bar 1 and nothing
else in the project moves — but the drag this flow used to describe no longer
exists, so the producer asks the arrangement for a loop and picks one instead.

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The library is a view on `4`, not
a modal, and the sequence editor a view on `2`. Asking the arrangement for a loop
aims the Library at a **new track** rather than at a slot, and Enter
inserts and goes back to where the producer came from — here, the arrangement.
Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The library contains a
tempo-labelled loop whose source tempo is not the tempo a new project opens at.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement, carrying the starter kick
   pattern.
2. Choose to add a loop from the library. The editor goes to the Library view,
   which fills the page. Its header says it is inserting into a new track, and
   it lists loops, not one-shots.
3. Find a drum loop that was recorded at a different tempo from the project's,
   and select it. The library opens on loops near the project's tempo, so widen
   it to any tempo to find one.
4. Press Enter. The loop is inserted and the editor goes back to the
   arrangement. A new track appears at the bottom of the track list, carrying
   that loop as a clip starting at bar 1.
5. Open that clip. The sequence view names it as a loop that follows the project
   tempo rather than a pitched one-shot, and states the tempo it was recorded at.
   Press 1 to go back to the arrangement.
6. Nothing else moved: the project tempo is unchanged, the loop brace is where it
   was, and the transport is still stopped.
7. Reload the page. The new track and its loop are still there.

**Outcome:** a producer brought a loop out of the library into their project
without leaving the arrangement, and the project it landed in is otherwise
exactly as they left it.

**Out of scope:** playback of any kind — pressing play belongs to CF-004, and
audibility is not provable here in any case. Loading a one-shot onto a sampler
from its instrument slot, which is the library modal's other entrypoint and is
asserted at the command layer. Choosing which bar the clip lands at, which the
product deliberately does not offer. And whether the stretched loop *sounds*
right, which no browser test can tell you.

### CF-006 — A producer brings their own sounds into a pack

**Issue:** #282 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-006.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Rewritten by #308.** This flow used to start on the landing page and log in
through the identity provider. Logging in was never what it set out to prove, and
depending on it made this flow answer for the login control's markup and for
Google's own account chooser — so a change to either reddened a flow about
importing sounds. Being signed in is now a precondition, the way "signed in with
no projects" already is for its neighbours, and the flow starts where the producer
starts. What it proves is unchanged.

**Made to pass by #282.** The library is the Library view (#817), and My packs
is in its rail: step 2 goes to it with `4`, and step 7's reload comes back to it.
The spec matches each sound by its whole name: the factory library carries a
"Dusty Tape Kick", which a search for "tape" lists beside the producer's
"tape kick".

**Changed by GRV-52.** An opened pack's sounds are listed in the library's main
region, where every pack's sounds are, rather than under its name in the rail.
The spec finds them there; the steps and what they assert are unchanged, and step
5 still drops on the pack's name in the rail.

**Preconditions:** signed in to a registered account whose personal library is
empty. Importing requires an account: a guest is offered the upgrade path instead,
which is asserted at the component layer rather than walked here.

1. You arrive on the dashboard signed in to your own account, not working as a
   guest.
2. Open a project, so the library browser is on screen.
3. Choose "Add pack". A new pack appears in the browser with its name in an
   input, waiting to be typed.
4. Type a name for the pack and press Return. The pack is now listed, and empty.
5. Drag three audio files from the desktop onto that pack. Each shows its own
   progress, and each lands as a sound in the pack when it finishes.
6. Audition one of them from the browser, and find it by searching the library
   the same way you would find a factory sound.
7. Reload the page. The pack and all three sounds are still there.

**Outcome:** the producer's own audio is in their library, in a pack they named,
sitting alongside the factory content and reachable the same way — which means
the next thing they can do is CF-005 with a sound of their own.

**Out of scope:** logging in — reaching an account through the identity provider
is a journey of its own and belongs to a flow of its own, so this one asserts only
that it begins signed in. Using one of those sounds in a project, which is CF-005
and is not re-proved here. Dropping files on empty space to create a pack called
"My Sounds", the file-picker fallback, renaming, deleting, and every rejection
path (unsupported file, oversized file, the account storage cap, a cancelled
upload) — all required, all covered at the component, repository and rules layers,
none of them the path that must not break.

### CF-007 — A producer drives the whole mix through an overdrive

**Issue:** #283 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-007.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Rewritten by #304.** The master chain is reached by selecting the master strip
in the **mixer view**, not by switching a main-region tab — #304 replaces that
tab with the three-view shell — and step 1 brings its loop in through the library
modal, as CF-005 now does. What the flow proves is unchanged.

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** Step 1 brings its loop in through
the Library view, as CF-005 now does, and the mixer is the view on `5`. The steps
read the same. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack lands.

**Revised for #937.** A new project's master starts with a visible Limiter in place
of the hidden safety limiter (a product-owner decision), so step 4 finds the Limiter
alone on the master chain rather than an empty chain. The overdrive goes on before it,
since a new master device never goes after a Limiter at the end;
what the flow proves is unchanged.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and bring a library loop into it, so the starter kick and
   a loop are in the project together.
2. Start playback. The two parts repeat over the loop brace.
3. Switch to the mixer.
4. Select the master strip. The master's effects are on screen, with only the
   Limiter a new project starts with on its chain. Add an overdrive to it.
5. Undo once. The overdrive comes off the master chain.
6. Redo. It is back.
7. While it is still playing, drive the overdrive up. The control follows and
   playback never drops out.
8. Reload the page. The project reopens on the mixer, and the overdrive is still
   on the master chain, still at that drive.

**Outcome:** a producer reached the master, put an effect across everything they
had made, pushed it while it played, and found the whole thing intact — on the
view they left it on — when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that the overdrive *sounds* like anything — a headless browser
records no audio, so this proves the chain, the controls, and the state, not the
processing, which is asserted in the audio suite. Track device chains (#241),
the other five device types, device presets, and reordering a chain, all of which
are tested at their own layers. Moving between the five views, which is CF-008's
subject and is only used here. Two orderings here are deliberate rather than
incidental. The undo and redo come *before* the drive is pushed, because a
parameter gesture is its own history entry: undoing after it would take back the
drive rather than the device, and redoing an add restores the device as its
payload described it. And both come before the reload, because history is
session-local — a reload legitimately ends the undo stack, so a flow that undid
afterwards would assert something the product does not promise.

### CF-008 — A producer moves between the five views by dock and by keyboard

**Issue:** #304, rewritten for #817 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-008.spec.ts` ·
**Entrypoint:** the project dashboard

**Rewritten for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** #304 gave the editor three views
and two modals; #817 makes the modals views of their own and puts all five on one
fixed map: `1` Arrangement, `2` Sequence, `3` Instrument, `4` Library, `5` Mixer.
The journey is the one it always was — do different jobs on uncluttered screens
and move between them without losing anything — on that map. Parked at
`test.fixme` until #817's stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement, which fills the page, with
   the starter pattern on the only track ("BD", a drum machine) and a dock
   floating along the bottom: five square tiles numbered 1 to 5, with the
   arrangement's marked as the view you are on.
2. Press 2 before choosing a clip. The sequence view says no clip is selected,
   tells you to select one in the arrangement, and offers a button back to the
   arrangement that shows its key, 1. Press that button. You are back on the
   arrangement.
3. Point at the dock's second tile. Its tip names the view, its key and what it
   will open; with no clip chosen it names no clip.
4. Open the clip on the timeline. The sequence view fills the page, showing the
   four-on-the-floor pattern on the "BD" pad, and the dock marks the sequence
   view as the one you are on.
5. Turn on a step that was off on the "BD" pad, then press 1. The arrangement is
   exactly as it was apart from the edit.
6. Press 3. The track's instrument fills the page, with a list of the project's
   tracks down the left edge and the dock marking the instrument view.
7. Press 5. The mixer fills the page with the "BD" track's strip marked as the
   one you came from. Pull its volume fader down.
8. Go back to the arrangement from the dock. The timeline is as you left it, and
   the dock marks the arrangement as the view you are on. Press the browser's
   back button: you are on the mixer again.
9. Reload the page. The project reopens on the mixer, with the fader still where
   you put it.

**Outcome:** a producer did different jobs on uncluttered screens, moved between
them by keys under one hand and by the dock without losing anything they had
done, was told plainly what a view needed when it had nothing to show, and the
view they were on survived the back button and a reload because it is part of
the address.

**Out of scope:** that any of it is *audible*, as in every other flow here. The
Library view, which CF-005 and CF-023 to CF-026 and CF-030 walk. The Library's
own empty screens (a synth track, no track), which are component-layer. Device
chains, which #241 and #283 own. Touch and tablet layouts, which #304 and #817
explicitly do not claim. The sequence view's own editing beyond one step
toggling, which CF-017 to CF-020 cover. What the tiles and icons look like.

### CF-009 — A producer clicks a clip and is told which one it is

**Issue:** #292 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-009.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. The starter clip sits on the "BD" track in bar 1, and
   nothing is selected.
2. Click the clip. It gets a solid outline, and the arrangement announces
   "Selected clip on BD, bar 1".
3. Click the empty space halfway through bar 3 on the same track. The clip's
   outline goes away, a cursor marks the start of the bar you clicked in, and
   the arrangement announces "Position 3.1.1".
4. Drag along the same track from the second sixteenth of bar 3 to its last
   sixteenth. A dotted outline follows the pointer while you drag. It touches
   no clip, so when you let go nothing is selected, and the arrangement
   announces "No selection".
5. Click the clip again, then reload the page.
6. The project reopens with nothing selected. Clicking the clip selects it and
   announces it exactly as before.

**Outcome:** there is one selection in the arrangement. Clicking a clip selects
that clip and names its bars. Clicking empty space sets a point at the start of
the bar you clicked in and names its position. Dragging over empty space selects
the clips the drag touches, and a drag that touches none selects nothing. Each
replaces the last, the band you drag and a selected clip look different, and a
screen reader is told which one happened. The clip is still there after a
reload, and the selection is not, because a selection belongs to the session and
not to the song.

**Out of scope:** what the outlines and the cursor look like. They are canvas
pixels, so this flow shows them in its walkthrough and the renderer's own tests
check them. Selecting several clips, which is CF-010. Zooming, which is CF-011.
Keyboard-only selection from the accessible track list.

### CF-010 — A producer drags across tracks to select clips and deletes them

**Issue:** #292 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-010.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, duplicate the "BD" clip, and drag the copy along to
   bar 3, so "BD" has a clip in bar 1 and another in bar 3 with bar 2 empty
   between them. Add a sampler track and drag the right edge of its clip out to
   the end of bar 2, so "Sampler" repeats its clip: one in bar 1 and a linked
   copy in bar 2.
2. Press in the empty bar 2 on "BD", at 2.3.1, and drag down and along to 4.3.1
   on "Sampler". A dotted outline follows the pointer across both tracks. When
   you let go it goes away, and the clips it touched are selected as whole
   clips: the "BD" clip in bar 3, which it wholly contained, and the "Sampler"
   clip in bar 2, which it overlapped. Each gets a solid outline, and the
   arrangement announces "2 clips selected". The "BD" and "Sampler" clips in
   bar 1 are not selected.
3. Press Delete. Both selected clips are gone, whole: nothing is trimmed. The
   clips in bar 1 on "BD" and "Sampler" are untouched. Clicking in bar 2 on
   "Sampler", where the deleted copy was, finds empty space and announces
   "Position 2.1.1". The same drag as in step 2 now touches no clip, and is
   announced as "No selection".
4. Reload the page.
5. The project reopens exactly as step 3 left it: both tracks are still there,
   and "BD" and "Sampler" each have only their clip in bar 1.

**Outcome:** a drag across more than one track selected every clip it contained
or overlapped, as whole clips. Delete removed exactly those clips, whole, and
nothing else: a clip the drag only partly covered went entirely rather than
being trimmed. The change was still there after a reload.

**Out of scope:** cut, copy, paste, duplicate and drag on a selection, which are
tested at the component layer against the same selection. Undo. What the
outlines look like, as in CF-009.

### CF-011 — A producer zooms in on what they selected

**Issue:** #292 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-011.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, add a sampler track, and duplicate the sampler's clip
   twice, so "Sampler" has clips in bars 1, 2 and 3 and "BD" has its one clip in
   bar 1.
2. Press halfway through the empty bar 2 on "BD" and drag down and along to
   halfway through bar 4 on "Sampler". The sampler's clips in bars 2 and 3,
   which the drag overlaps and wholly contains, are selected as whole clips, and
   the arrangement announces "2 clips selected".
3. Zoom to selection from the zoom control over the arrangement. The timeline now shows exactly the
   selected clips and nothing else: the start of bar 2 at its left edge and the
   end of bar 3 at its right edge. The half bars you dragged over either side
   of them are not framed.
4. Click the sampler's clip in bar 3 and press Z. Bar 3 alone now fills the
   timeline, edge to edge.
5. Reload the page.
6. The project reopens with nothing selected, so zoom to selection has nothing
   to act on until you select something again.

**Outcome:** zoom to selection frames exactly the selected clips, from the first
one's start to the last one's end, however far the drag that selected them
reached past them, and a single clicked clip, where it used to do nothing. It
works from the zoom control and from the keyboard.

**Out of scope:** "zoom back" to the previous zoom, which is its own shortcut. A
selection wider than the timeline can show at its closest zoom. What the
outlines look like, as in CF-009.

### CF-012 — A producer builds an effects chain on one track

**Issue:** #241 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-012.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** Step 1 brings its loop in through
the Library view, as CF-005 now does. The steps read the same. Parked at
`test.fixme` until #817's stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and bring a library loop into it, so the starter kick and
   the loop sit on two tracks.
2. Switch to the mixer and select the loop's track. Go to the instrument view. It
   shows the loop's track, and its device chain is empty.
3. Add a filter to the chain. It appears with its own controls — cutoff and the
   rest of its settings — not a list of presets.
4. Add a delay. It appears after the filter, and the chain reads filter, then
   delay.
5. Undo once. The delay comes off; the filter stays. Redo. The delay is back,
   after the filter.
6. Start playback. While it plays, sweep the filter's cutoff down. The control
   follows, and playback never drops out.
7. Undo once. The cutoff returns to where it was before the sweep, in one step.
8. Select the kick's track in the mixer and return to the instrument view. Its
   device chain is empty — the filter and delay belong to the loop's track only.
9. Reload the page. Select the loop's track again. The filter and the delay are
   still on it, in that order, with the filter's settings as you left them.

**Outcome:** a producer put two effects on one sound, shaped one of them while it
played, took back a mistake in a single step, and found the chain — on the right
track, in the right order — when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that the effects are *audible*: a headless browser records no
audio, so this proves the chain, the controls, and the state; the processing is
asserted in the audio suite. The master chain, which is CF-007's (#283). The other
four device types, which share the same controls and are covered at the component
layer. The sixteen-insert limit, which is a unit-layer bound, not a journey.
Ordering is deliberate here, as in CF-007: undo/redo come before the reload
because history is session-local.

### CF-013 — A producer rearranges a track's chain while it plays

**Issue:** #241 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-013.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. Go to the instrument view for the starter track, and add
   an overdrive and then a reverb to its chain.
2. Start playback.
3. While it plays, move the reverb before the overdrive. The chain now reads
   reverb, then overdrive, and playback never drops out.
4. Bypass the overdrive. It stays in its place in the chain, marked as bypassed,
   with its settings unchanged.
5. Duplicate the reverb. A second reverb appears directly after the first, with
   the same settings.
6. Turn the second reverb's size up, then reset it. Its controls return to their
   defaults; the first reverb is untouched.
7. Remove the second reverb. The chain reads reverb, then the bypassed overdrive.
8. Undo once. The removed reverb returns in the same place.
9. Stop playback and reload the page. The chain reads reverb, reverb, overdrive,
   with the overdrive still bypassed and the second reverb still at its defaults.

**Outcome:** a producer reshaped an effects chain without stopping the music —
reordered it, switched one effect out of the signal without losing it, copied,
reset and removed — and everything they kept was there when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that reordering is *click-free* in the audio sense, which a
headless browser cannot hear; the flow proves playback keeps running, and the
node reuse that makes it click-free is asserted against `DeviceChain` in the audio
suite. Return-bus chains and sends. Analytics (`device_added`,
`feature_first_use`), which are asserted once-per-action at the unit layer, not
through a journey.

### CF-014 — A producer drags their tracks into order

**Issue:** #331 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-014.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement with the starter track, BD.
   Add a synth track and then a sampler track. The track list reads BD, Synth,
   Sampler, top to bottom.
2. Start playback.
3. While it plays, drag the Sampler track's header up over BD. Before you let go,
   a marker shows the track will land at the top. Let go: the list reads Sampler,
   BD, Synth, and playback never stops.
4. Drag BD's header off the track list and let go over the view dock. Nothing
   moves: the list still reads Sampler, BD, Synth.
5. Undo once. The list reads BD, Synth, Sampler — the whole drag comes back in
   one step. Redo, and it reads Sampler, BD, Synth again.
6. Go to the mixer. The strips read Sampler, BD, Synth, left to right. Drag the
   Synth strip to the far left. Before you let go, a marker shows where it will
   land. Let go: the strips read Synth, Sampler, BD, and playback is still
   running.
7. Using only the keyboard, move BD one place to the left. The strips read Synth,
   BD, Sampler.
8. Go to the instrument view. The track list down its left edge reads Synth, BD,
   Sampler.
9. Stop playback and reload the page. The instrument view's track list still
   reads Synth, BD, Sampler, and so does the arrangement's.

**Outcome:** a producer put their tracks in the order they think in with one drag
each, in whichever view they were looking at, without stopping the music; a drag
they abandoned changed nothing, the keyboard can do the same job, and every view
agreed on the order when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that the reorder is *inaudible*, which a headless browser cannot
hear: the flow proves playback keeps running, and that `ProjectAudioGraph` reuses
every node on a reorder is asserted in the audio suite. That a track's clips,
instrument, devices and mixer settings travel with it, which `track.reorder`'s
command tests hold. Analytics, asserted once-per-action at the unit layer.
Reordering returns or the master, multi-select drags, and touch drags.

### CF-015 — A producer picks out several clips with the keyboard held down

**Issue:** #405 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-015.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, duplicate the "BD" clip twice, add a sampler track, and
   duplicate its clip twice, so "BD" and "Sampler" each have clips in bars 1, 2
   and 3.
2. Click the "BD" clip in bar 1. It alone is selected, and the arrangement
   announces "Selected clip on BD, bar 1".
3. Hold Cmd (Ctrl on Windows and Linux) and click the "BD" clip in bar 3. It
   joins the selection without replacing it, and the arrangement announces
   "2 clips selected". The "BD" clip in bar 2, between them, is not selected.
4. Hold Cmd and click the "BD" clip in bar 1 again. It leaves the selection, and
   the arrangement announces "Selected clip on BD, bar 3".
5. Hold Shift and click the "Sampler" clip in bar 2. The selection grows to every
   clip in the box from what was selected to the clip you clicked, across both
   tracks: the clips in bars 2 and 3 on "BD" and on "Sampler". The arrangement
   announces "4 clips selected". The clips in bar 1 on both tracks are not
   selected.
6. Press Delete. The four selected clips are gone, whole, and the clips in bar 1
   on both tracks are untouched.
7. Reload the page.
8. The project reopens exactly as step 6 left it: "BD" and "Sampler" each have
   only their clip in bar 1, and nothing is selected.

**Outcome:** holding Cmd while clicking a clip adds it to the selection or takes
it out, one clip at a time, without losing the rest. Holding Shift while clicking
a clip extends the selection to every clip in the box between the selection and
the clicked clip, on every track in between. What a producer builds this way is
one selection, which acts like any other: Delete removed exactly those clips, and
the change was still there after a reload.

**Out of scope:** Shift-click or Cmd-click on empty space, and Shift-drag or
Cmd-drag, which this flow does not define. Shift-click with nothing selected.
Cut, copy, paste, duplicate, drag and zoom on a selection built this way, which
act on the same selection as CF-010 and CF-011 and are tested at the component
layer. What the outlines look like, as in CF-009.

### CF-016 — A producer Alt-drags clips to copy them

**Issue:** #456 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-016.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #496.** The "BD" clip is a drum-machine clip, so steps 5-8 read
and edit the "BD" pad's lane. Alt-drag itself is unchanged and already live;
parked at `test.fixme` only until #496's starter lands.

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The sequence editor is a view on
`2`, not a window over the arrangement, so opening a clip goes to it and
"close the editor" in steps 5-6 is pressing 1 to go back to the
arrangement. The journey is unchanged. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack
lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and add a sampler track, so "BD" (the starter drum
   machine) and "Sampler" each have one clip, in bar 1.
2. Press in the empty bar 2 on "BD" and drag down and back to the middle of bar 1
   on "Sampler". Both clips in bar 1 are selected, and the arrangement announces
   "2 clips selected".
3. Hold Alt (Option on macOS), press on the "BD" clip in bar 1, drag it along to
   bar 3, and let go. Copies of both selected clips land in bar 3, one on each
   track. The clips in bar 1 have not moved, and bar 2 is still empty on both
   tracks. The copies are now the selection, and the arrangement announces
   "2 clips selected".
4. Hold Alt again, press on the "BD" clip in bar 3, and drag it along to bar 5.
   Copies of both clips from bar 3 land in bar 5, one on each track, so the copies
   made in step 3 were what was selected.
5. Open the "BD" clip in bar 5. Turn on a step that was off on the "BD" pad, and
   press 1 to go back to the arrangement.
6. Open the "BD" clip in bar 1. The step you turned on in bar 5 is still off on
   the "BD" pad here. Press 1.
7. Reload the page.
8. The project reopens exactly as step 6 left it: "BD" and "Sampler" each have
   clips in bars 1, 3 and 5, with bars 2 and 4 empty, and the step you turned on
   is on only in the "BD" clip in bar 5.

**Outcome:** holding Alt while dragging a selected clip copied every selected clip
instead of moving it, keeping their spacing and their tracks, and left the
originals where they were. The copies became the selection, so a second Alt-drag
copied them again. Each copy is independent: editing it did not change the clip it
came from. All of it was still there after a reload.

**Out of scope:** letting go of Alt, or pressing it, partway through a drag, which
decides move or copy at the drop and is tested at the component layer, as are
Escape mid-drag and undoing an Alt-drag as one step. A copy landing on another
clip, which overwrites it exactly as a plain drag does (#290). Alt-drag on a clip
edge, which resizes as a plain edge drag does. Touch input. What the dragged
copies look like while they move, as in CF-009.

### CF-017 — A producer writes a bassline in the piano roll

**Issue:** #450 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-017.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The sequence editor is a view on
`2`, not a window over the arrangement, so opening a clip goes to it and
step 8 leaves it with 1. The journey is unchanged. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack
lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and add a synth track. Its clip sits in bar 1. Open it. The
   sequence view shows the piano roll: 16 steps, rows named down the left with
   white rows for white keys and black rows for black keys, and the key reads
   "Chromatic".
2. Click the empty cell at C2, step 1. A one-step note appears there, selected.
   Click C2 step 5, D♯2 step 9 and G2 step 13. The clip has four notes.
3. Drag the right edge of the note at C2 step 1 one step to the right. It is now two
   steps long. Click the empty cell at F2 step 15. The new note is also two steps
   long.
4. Drag the note at D♯2 step 9 up two rows and right one step. It lands at F2
   step 10.
5. Press in the empty cell at C2 step 6 and drag left to step 1. The two C2 notes
   are selected, and the roll reads "2 selected".
6. Hold Alt (Option on macOS), press on the note at C2 step 1, drag it right by
   eight steps and let go. Copies land at C2 steps 9 and 13. The originals have not
   moved.
7. Double-click the note at G2 step 13. It is deleted.
8. Press 1 to go back to the arrangement, and reload the page. Open the clip
   again.

**Outcome:** the clip holds six notes: C2 at steps 1 (two steps long), 5, 9 (two
steps long) and 13, F2 at step 10, and F2 at step 15 (two steps long). Clicking,
dragging, resizing, lassoing, Alt-copying and double-click deleting all went through
the command layer, and the result survived a reload.

**Out of scope:** keyboard nudges and shortcuts (CF-019), the velocity lane, zoom,
auto-scroll, audition and Shift/Cmd-click toggling, which are tested at the
component layer. Touch input.

### CF-018 — A producer picks a key and pulls stray notes into it

**Issue:** #450 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-018.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The sequence editor is a view on
`2`, not a window over the arrangement, so opening a clip goes to it and
step 6 leaves it with 1. The journey is unchanged. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack
lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, add a synth track and open its clip. The key reads
   "Chromatic", the root buttons are disabled, and Quantize to scale is disabled.
2. Add notes at C2 step 1, F♯2 step 5 and D♯2 step 9.
3. Choose Minor from the scale switch. The root buttons are enabled with C chosen,
   and the key reads "C minor". The roll shows only C minor rows, plus an F♯2 row
   marked Off, which holds the F♯2 note. No C♯2 or E2 row is shown.
4. Press Quantize to scale. The F♯2 note moves onto a C minor row, and the Off row
   disappears. The C2 and D♯2 notes have not changed.
5. Undo. The F♯2 note and its Off row are back. Redo. They are gone again.
6. Press 1 to go back to the arrangement, and reload the page. Open the clip
   again.

**Outcome:** the key reads "C minor" and the roll shows only C minor rows, so the key
was saved with the project. The clip holds three notes, all in C minor.

**Out of scope:** which scale note Quantize to scale picks (the rule is the
implementer's, tested at the unit layer). Every scale other than Minor. Changing the
root with notes out of key. Key changes from anywhere other than the piano roll.

### CF-019 — A producer copies, pastes and transforms notes from the keyboard

**Issue:** #450, #647, #650 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-019.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The sequence editor is a view on
`2`, not a window over the arrangement, so opening a clip goes to it and
step 7 leaves it with 1 rather than Esc: a view is not a dialog, and
Esc closes dialogs (#650). The journey is unchanged. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack
lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, add a synth track and open its clip. Add notes at C2 step 1
   and G2 step 3.
2. Press ⌘A (Ctrl+A on Windows and Linux). The roll reads "2 selected". Press ⌘C.
   Click the ruler at step 9, then press ⌘V. Copies land at C2 step 9 and G2
   step 11, and the copies are now the selection.
3. Press ↑. The copies move up one row, to C♯2 step 9 and G♯2 step 11. Undo. They
   are back at C2 and G2.
4. Press Delete. The copies are gone and two notes remain.
5. Nothing is selected now. The Transform panel reads "All 2 notes". The
   Transpose field reads "+12 st". Press Transpose. The notes are now at C3 step 1
   and G3 step 3.
6. Press Double. The one-bar clip becomes two bars long, and copies land at C3
   step 17 and G3 step 19.
7. Press 1. The editor goes back to the arrangement. Reload the page and open the
   clip again.

**Outcome:** the clip is two bars long and holds C3 at steps 1 and 17 and G3 at
steps 3 and 19. Keyboard copy and paste landed at the insert marker, arrow keys
and Delete acted on the selection, a transform with nothing selected acted on the
whole clip, and Double made room for its copies (#647).

**Out of scope:** ⌘D, cut, Shift+arrow resizing and octave moves, Quantize,
Velocity, Vary, Clear clip, and editing the value fields, which are tested at the
component layer. Double's stretching of the clip's arrangement placements, and its
refusal at the longest clip length, are tested at the command layer.

<!--
  New flows go here, in ascending ID order. Never renumber or reuse an ID: a
  retired flow keeps its number and gains a "**Retired:** why" line, because
  closed issues, merged PRs, and old walkthroughs still reference it.

### CF-020 — A producer fills a drum row from the Generate panel

**Issue:** #643 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-020.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The sequence editor is a view on
`2`, not a window over the arrangement, so opening a clip goes to it and
step 7 goes straight from it to the instrument view with 3. The journey is unchanged. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack
lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. Go to the instrument view for the starter "BD" track and
   add a pad. It is called "Pad 2".
2. Go to the arrangement and open the "BD" clip. The step grid shows a "BD" row
   with steps 1, 5, 9 and 13 on, and an empty "Pad 2" row.
3. Click the "Pad 2" row's name. It becomes the selected row, and the Generate
   panel reads "into Pad 2".
4. Press Offbeats. The "Pad 2" row has steps 3, 7, 11 and 15 on. The "BD" row has
   not changed.
5. Set the Euclidean generator to 3 hits over 8 steps and press Write. The "Pad 2"
   row now has steps 1, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 15 on, and nothing else. The offbeats are
   gone. The "BD" row has not changed.
6. Undo once. The "Pad 2" row is back to the offbeats. Redo. It is back to the
   Euclidean pattern.
7. Press 3. The instrument view shows the "BD" drum machine, and "Pad 2" is the
   selected pad.
8. Reload the page. Go to the arrangement and open the "BD" clip again.

**Outcome:** the "BD" row has steps 1, 5, 9 and 13 on, and the "Pad 2" row has
steps 1, 4, 7, 9, 12 and 15 on. A producer picked a row by its name and filled it
from a preset and from the Euclidean generator. Each generate replaced only that
row, as one undo step, and the result survived a reload.

**Out of scope:** the Random generator, whose output is random, and Clear row,
which are tested at the component layer. The hover preview. Generated
velocities and the velocity lane. The piano-roll toolbar's Zoom, Select all and
Delete, which CF-017 and CF-019 cover in the piano roll. The other presets.

### CF-021 — A producer exports their song as a stereo WAV

**Issue:** #64, #65 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-021.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:**
the project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. It opens with the starter drum machine, its "BD" pad four on
   the floor. Add a drum-machine track named "Drums", and on it put the "HH" pad on
   every offbeat and the "CP" pad on beats 2 and 4.
2. Add a synth track named "Bass" and write a bassline in the piano roll: C2 on steps
   1 and 9, D♯2 on step 5, G2 on step 13.
3. Add a loop from the library: a drum loop recorded at a different tempo from the
   project's. It lands on a new track as a clip starting at bar 1.
4. Add a sampler track named "Piano" and load the "Tine Electric Key" one-shot from the
   library. In the piano roll write a C minor chord on step 1 (C3, D♯3 and G3 at once) and a single A♯3
   on step 9, so the sample plays at four pitches and three at a time.
5. Add a reverb to the Piano track's effects.
6. Switch to the mixer and select the master strip. Add a saturator, then a compressor,
   to the master's effects. Both land before the Limiter a new project starts with,
   which stays last (#937).
7. There are now five tracks, each with a clip in bar 1. Play the song, then stop.
8. Press Export in the editor header. A dialog opens with two choices, Stereo WAV and
   Stems (ZIP). Stereo WAV is chosen.
9. Press Export. A progress bar with a Cancel button shows while it renders. When it
   finishes, the browser downloads one file named `<project name> <YYYY-MM-DD>.wav`, and
   the dialog says the export is done.
10. Close the dialog and reload the page.

**Outcome:** the file is a valid stereo WAV (two channels, 24-bit PCM, the project's
sample rate), and it is not silent. It runs from bar 1 to the end of the last clip at
the song tempo, plus no more than the release tail. Its level is the project's own:
nothing was normalized (DEC-004). After the reload the project is unchanged — five
tracks, same clips and notes, the reverb on Piano and the saturator and compressor on
the master — so exporting did not edit it.

**Out of scope:** cancelling, failure paths and analytics (unit and component layers).
Exact tail length, sample-accurate timing and live/offline parity (reference renders,
#64). The 40-track ten-minute fixture and memory limits. Stems (CF-022).

### CF-022 — A producer exports aligned stems for another DAW

**Issue:** #66 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-022.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project. It opens with the starter drum machine, its "BD" pad four on
   the floor. Add a drum-machine track named "Drums", and on it put the "HH" pad on
   every offbeat and the "CP" pad on beats 2 and 4.
2. Add a synth track named "Bass" and write a bassline in the piano roll: C2 on steps
   1 and 9, D♯2 on step 5, G2 on step 13.
3. Add a loop from the library: a drum loop recorded at a different tempo from the
   project's. It lands on a new track as a clip starting at bar 1.
4. Add a sampler track named "Piano" and load the "Tine Electric Key" one-shot from the
   library. In the piano roll write a C minor chord on step 1 (C3, D♯3 and G3 at once) and a single A♯3
   on step 9, so the sample plays at four pitches and three at a time.
5. Add a reverb to the Piano track's effects.
6. Switch to the mixer and select the master strip. Add a saturator, then a compressor,
   to the master's effects. Both land before the Limiter a new project starts with,
   which stays last (#937).
7. There are now five tracks, each with a clip in bar 1. Play the song, then stop.
8. Press Export in the editor header and choose Stems (ZIP). No bit-depth choice
   appears: stems are always 24-bit.
9. Press Export and let it finish. The browser downloads one file named
   `<project name> <YYYY-MM-DD> stems.zip`.
10. Close the dialog and reload the page.

**Outcome:** the ZIP holds five WAVs, one per track, named with its position and track
name (`01 BD.wav`, `02 Drums.wav`, `03 Bass.wav`, `04 <loop track>.wav`, `05 Piano.wav`)
so they sort in track order, each with sound in it, plus `Reference mix.wav`, and nothing else. Every
WAV is stereo, 24-bit PCM, at the same sample rate, and exactly the same length. After
the reload the project is unchanged, devices included.

**Out of scope:** mute/solo (every track is exported whatever its
mute/solo state), return-bus stems (these go in a `Returns/` folder, but no UI adds a
return yet), sample-by-sample alignment, master processing
being excluded, cancelling, the maximum reference fixture, worker/memory limits,
failure paths and analytics — all tested at the unit and component layers.

### CF-023 — A producer finds a kick by ear and puts it on a pad

**Issue:** #449 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-023.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The library is a view on `4`
that fills the page, not a window over the editor. A sample slot opens it aimed
at that slot, inserting keeps it open so another sound can be tried, and `3` goes
back to the instrument without inserting. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's
stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The library holds kicks tagged
with genres.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement, with the starter kick on a
   drum machine's "BD" pad.
2. Go to the instrument view. The "BD" pad's sample slot shows the library's
   icon and its key, 4. Press the slot. The editor goes to the Library view,
   which fills the page. Its header names the slot it will fill as a path
   ending at the "BD" pad, shows the sound the pad has now, and it is already
   showing kicks.
3. Choose a genre from the genre menu. The list narrows to kicks in that genre,
   and says how many there are.
4. Click a kick. It is selected, and the library says it is the one you are
   hearing.
5. Press the down arrow. The next kick is selected and is the one you are
   hearing now.
6. Press 3. The editor goes back to the instrument view, and the pad's sample
   slot still names the sound it had before. Nothing in the project changed
   while you listened.
7. Press the slot again, select a different kick, and press Insert. The editor
   goes back to the instrument view, and the slot names the kick you chose.
8. Reload the page. The "BD" pad still holds the kick you inserted.

**Outcome:** a producer heard several kicks in place, walked away from them
without a trace, then chose one with a single button, and it is still there
when they come back.

**Out of scope:** that the auditions are *audible*, or heard through the pad in
the beat. No headless browser records audio, so hot-swap audio is asserted in
the audio suite. Loops, which are CF-005's. The similar-sounds view (CF-025) and
packs (CF-024). Trying several sounds in a row by key, which is CF-030's. Shuffle, and the arrow buttons on the category row, are covered
at the component layer.

### CF-024 — A producer browses packs and uses a sound from one they did not have

**Issue:** #449 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-024.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The library is a view on `4`
that fills the page, not a window over the editor. A sample slot opens it aimed
at that slot, inserting keeps it open so another sound can be tried, and `3` goes
back to the instrument without inserting. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's
stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and go to the instrument view. Press the sample slot of
   the drum machine's "BD" pad. The editor goes to the Library view.
2. Choose Browse packs. The sound list gives way to pack covers, and the packs
   this project already uses are marked as in the project.
3. Narrow the packs to those with FX.
4. Open Transitions & FX, a pack the project does not use. Its sounds replace
   the covers, under a banner that names the pack and says it joins the project
   when you insert one of its sounds.
5. Choose the FX family, then the Impact category. Only that pack's impacts are
   listed.
6. Select an impact and press Insert. The editor goes back to the instrument
   view, and the "BD" pad's slot names that impact.
7. Press 4. The library is still aimed at the "BD" pad, and Transitions & FX is
   now listed with the project's own packs.
8. Reload the page. The "BD" pad still holds the impact, and Transitions & FX is
   still listed with the project's packs.

**Outcome:** a producer found a new pack, looked inside it, and used one of its
sounds. Taking the sound brought the pack into the project, with no separate
step to add it.

**Out of scope:** "Hear it" on a pack cover, which is audio. The pack search
text, and the scrolling of a long category row, which are component-layer.
Removing a pack from a project, which this issue does not offer. Third-party and
personal packs, whose cover and banner are the same parts.

### CF-025 — A producer follows similar sounds to a better kick

**Issue:** #449 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-025.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The library is a view on `4`
that fills the page, not a window over the editor. A sample slot opens it aimed
at that slot, inserting keeps it open so another sound can be tried, and `3` goes
back to the instrument without inserting. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's
stack lands.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The library holds several kicks
whose tags overlap.

1. Create a new project, go to the instrument view and press the "BD" pad's
   sample slot. The Library view shows kicks.
2. Press the similar-sounds button on a kick. The list gives way to that kick's
   closest matches. Each shows how close it is, and the kick you started from
   is named above them.
3. Turn off matching on genre. The matches update.
4. Press the similar-sounds button on one of the matches. Its own matches
   replace the list, and a trail shows both kicks, in the order you visited
   them.
5. Choose the first kick in the trail. Its matches come back.
6. Go back. The list of kicks you started from returns.
7. Open similar sounds again from any kick, select one of its matches and
   press Insert. The editor goes back to the instrument view, and the slot
   names that match.
8. Reload the page. The pad still holds it.

**Outcome:** a producer went from "like this, but…" to a sound they chose,
and could retrace every step of the way.

**Out of scope:** how the closeness is computed, which is unit-tested against
the similarity model. Whether the matches *sound* alike, which no browser test
can tell. Matches drawn from other packs, which the similarity model's unit
tests cover.

### CF-026 — A producer keeps a sound as a favourite and finds it in another project

**Issue:** #449 (favourites slice), after #691 · **Suite:**
`tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-026.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the project dashboard

**Revised for #817 (five views on `1`–`5`).** The library is a view on `4`,
so leaving it without inserting is pressing 3, not closing a window.

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects and no favourites. Favourites
are stored per user by #691; #815 built the hearts and the Favourites place.

1. Create a new project, go to the instrument view and press the "BD" pad's
   sample slot. The editor goes to the Library view.
2. Mark a kick as a favourite. Its heart fills, and Favourites counts one.
3. Press 3 to go back to the instrument view without inserting anything.
4. Go back to the dashboard and create a second project. Press its "BD" pad's
   sample slot and choose Favourites. The kick you marked is listed.
5. Insert it. The editor goes back to the instrument view, and the slot names
   that kick.
6. Reload the page. Press 4 and choose Favourites. The kick is still there,
   still marked.

**Outcome:** a sound a producer liked once stays with them, across projects and
reloads, one click away from any slot.

**Out of scope:** favourites following the account to another device or
browser, and a guest's favourites carrying over when they register. Both are
#691's and are asserted in the emulator rules and repository suites.
Unfavouriting, which is component-layer.

### CF-027 — A producer asks the assistant for a change, tries it, and keeps it

**Issue:** #72 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-027.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The assistant is answered by the
suite's scripted provider (#69). Asked to loosen the beat, it replies with a
proposal of two changes: swing up to 58%, and the BD track 3 dB quieter. Once
the assistant disclosure exists (#95), this account has already seen it.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement.
2. Press the Cue button in the header. The assistant opens floating over
   the bottom-right corner of the editor, ready to type into. It says its scope
   is the selected track, BD.
3. Type "Loosen the beat" and press Enter. Your message appears in the
   conversation, marked with its scope, and the assistant's reply follows it.
4. The reply ends with a proposal that lists both changes, each from its
   current value to the new one. Nothing in the song has changed yet: swing
   reads what it did before.
5. Press Preview. The editor goes to the mixer, where the change can be seen.
   BD's volume fader sits at the proposed level, and swing reads 58%.
6. Press Cancel. The editor goes back to the arrangement. Swing reads what it
   did before, and BD's volume is where it was. There is nothing to undo.
7. Press Preview again, then Apply. The proposal says it was applied. Swing
   reads 58%, and BD's volume is at the proposed level.
8. Undo once. Both changes are gone. Redo once. Both are back.
9. Reload the page. Swing still reads 58%, and BD's volume is still at the
   proposed level.

**Outcome:** a producer asked for a change in words, tried it before anything
was saved, walked away from it without a trace, then kept it as one step they
can undo, and it is still there when they come back.

**Out of scope:** what the assistant says, and whether a real model proposes
anything useful, which `AI-005` evaluates. Stopping a reply, a provider failure,
a proposal that goes out of date under an edit, and "Why this works", which are
tested at the component and emulator layers. The outlines that mark previewed
and changed controls, which are component-layer. That a preview is audible. No
headless browser records audio. Pack and video recommendations, which are other
issues.

### CF-028 — The assistant stays where a producer puts it

**Issue:** #849 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-028.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects, in a browser that has never
opened the assistant.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement.
2. Press Ctrl+K (⌘K on a Mac). The assistant opens floating over the
   bottom-right corner of the editor.
3. Drag its top edge up. It grows taller and stays at the bottom of the window.
4. Press Minimise. It shrinks to a bar at the bottom-right that still names the
   assistant. Click the bar. It floats again, at the height you set.
5. Press Dock. It becomes a column down the right edge, and the arrangement
   narrows so that nothing is under it.
6. Drag its left edge to the left. The column widens, and the arrangement
   narrows with it.
7. Press Close. The column goes, and the arrangement fills the window again.
   Press Ctrl+K. The assistant comes back docked, at the width you set.
8. Reload the page. The assistant is docked at the same width, as you left it.
   Press Float. It floats at the height you set in step 3.

**Outcome:** a producer arranged the assistant to suit the way they work, and
it stays that way across a reload on this device.

**Out of scope:** the panel following the producer to another browser or
device, which it deliberately does not. Resizing from the keyboard, the
double-click that resets a size, and the smallest and largest sizes, which are
component-layer. That Ctrl+K does not clash with another shortcut, which the
shortcut registry's own tests assert. The conversation itself (CF-027).

### CF-029 — A producer selects every clip in the arrangement with Cmd+A

**Issue:** #835 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-029.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project, duplicate the "BD" clip twice, add a sampler track, and
   duplicate its clip once, so "BD" has clips in bars 1, 2 and 3 and "Sampler"
   has clips in bars 1 and 2.
2. Click the "BD" clip in bar 1. It alone is selected, and the arrangement
   announces "Selected clip on BD, bar 1".
3. Press Cmd+A (Ctrl+A on Windows and Linux). Every clip on both tracks is
   selected, and the arrangement announces "5 clips selected". No text on the
   page is highlighted.
4. Press Escape. Nothing is selected, and the arrangement announces "No
   selection".
5. Press Cmd+A again. Every clip is selected again, the arrangement announces
   "5 clips selected", and no text on the page is highlighted.
6. Press Delete. All five clips are gone. Both tracks are still there, empty.
7. Reload the page.
8. The project reopens exactly as step 6 left it: "BD" and "Sampler" are there,
   with no clips.

**Outcome:** with the arrangement in use, Cmd+A selected every clip in the song,
on every track, whether or not something was selected first, and never the
page's text. Escape cleared the selection. What Cmd+A selected is one selection
that acts like any other: Delete removed exactly those clips, and the change was
still there after a reload.

**Out of scope:** clips outside the visible part of the arrangement, and a song
with no clips, which are tested at the component layer. Cmd+A in the piano roll
(CF-019) and in a text field, which the shortcut registry's own tests cover.
Cut, copy, paste, duplicate and drag on a selection made this way, which act on
the same selection as CF-010 and are tested at the component layer. Undo. What
the outlines look like, as in CF-009.

### CF-030 — A producer tries several kicks on a pad without leaving the library

**Issue:** #817 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-030.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The library holds at least three
kicks besides the starter's.

1. Create a new project and press 3. The instrument view shows the starter drum
   machine. Add a pad: it is called "Pad 2", it is the selected pad, and its
   empty sample slot is marked as the library's target.
2. Press the "BD" pad to select it. Now the "BD" pad's sample slot is the one
   marked as the target, and "Pad 2"'s is not.
3. Point at the dock's fourth tile. Its tip says it will open the Library on
   sounds for the "BD" track.
4. Press 4. The Library view fills the page. Its header says it is inserting
   into the "BD" track's drum machine, on the "BD" pad, names the kick the pad
   holds now, and lists one-shots, not loops.
5. Select a different kick and press Shift+Enter. The library stays open and
   shows that kick as the sound in the slot. Press the down arrow to select the
   next kick and press Shift+Enter again. The library is still open, and shows
   the second kick in the slot.
6. Undo once. The library shows the first kick in the slot again.
7. Select a third kick and press Enter. The editor goes back to the
   instrument view, with the "BD" pad selected, its slot naming the third kick
   and still marked as the target.
8. Press 1, then 4. The library is still aimed at the "BD" pad. Press 3 to go
   back without inserting. The slot still names the third kick.
9. Reload the page. The "BD" pad holds the third kick, and "Pad 2" is still
   empty.

**Outcome:** a producer aimed the library at one pad by touching it, tried two
sounds there by key without the library closing, took one back in a single undo,
kept a third and landed back on the pad they started from. The library stayed
aimed at that pad across views, and the sound they kept was still there when they
came back.

**Out of scope:** that any sound is *audible*. The sampler's and the loop
player's slots, which share the same part and are covered at the component
layer, as are the Library's empty screens (a synth track, no track) and what the
slot's target edge and the dock's target dot look like. Choosing sounds, packs,
genres and similar sounds, which CF-023 to CF-026 own.

### CF-031 — A producer sends a track to a reverb return

**Issue:** #386 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-031.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:** the
project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects.

1. Create a new project and switch to the mixer. The starter track's strip and
   the master are there, and no returns.
2. Add a return. A return strip appears after the tracks and before the master,
   with its own volume and pan. Rename it "Verb".
3. Select the return and go to the instrument view. It shows the return's device
   chain, empty, and no instrument. Add a reverb to it.
4. Go back to the mixer. The return's strip reads Reverb. Send the starter track
   to the return, and drag the send level up.
5. Undo once. The send level drops back to where the send started, in one step.
   Redo. It is back up.
6. Turn the return's volume down.
7. Remove the return. Its strip goes, and so does the starter track's send to
   it. Undo once. The return is back, with its reverb, and so is the send, at the
   level you left it.
8. Reload the page. The project reopens on the mixer. The return is still called
   "Verb", still carries the reverb and still sits at the volume you set, and the
   starter track still sends to it at that level.

**Outcome:** a producer made a shared effects bus, put a reverb on it, sent a
track to it, took a deletion back in one step with everything that hung off it,
and found the whole routing intact when they came back.

**Out of scope:** that the return is *audible*: a headless browser records no
audio, so this proves the routing, the controls and the state; the signal path
from a send into a return is asserted in the audio suite. A return's chain
editing beyond adding one device (reorder, bypass, duplicate, reset), which is
the same panel CF-012 and CF-013 walk through on a track. Several returns, the
eight-return limit, pre-fader sends, return mute and automation, which are
covered at the unit and component layers. As in CF-007, undo and redo come
before the reload because history is session-local.

### CF-032 — A visitor who is not on the alpha list is told so and asks for access

**Issue:** #854 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-032.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:**
the public landing page

**Preconditions:** a Google account whose address is not on the alpha list.

1. Open the landing page.
2. Choose Sign in, and sign in with Google as the address that is not on the
   list.
3. You are not let in. A page tells you you're not on the alpha list yet, and
   offers Request access.
4. Reload the page. You are still not signed in, and the page still says so.
5. Open your projects page directly. You are not let in there either, and land
   back on the landing page.
6. Go back, and follow Request access. The request-access form opens.

**Outcome:** someone the alpha has not invited cannot get in by signing in, is
told why in plain words rather than shown an error, and is one press away from
asking for access.

**Out of scope:** what the form asks and where its answers go, which is a third
party's page (the flow answers its address locally). Being approved afterwards:
an admin approving the address from the admin page or the `allowlist:add` script
is covered by the rules and component tests, and CF-001 is what an approved
address then does. A guest from before the alpha closed upgrading to an address
that is not on the list, which the same blocking function refuses and is tested
below the browser.

### CF-033 — A producer finds a sound they heard earlier

**Issue:** #815 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-033.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:**
the project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects, on a browser that has auditioned
nothing. The library holds at least three kicks besides the starter's.

1. Create a new project, go to the instrument view and press the "BD" pad's
   sample slot. The editor goes to the Library view. Choose Recently heard. It
   says nothing has been heard yet, and how to hear something.
2. Go back to All sounds and hear three kicks, one after another, without
   inserting any.
3. Choose Recently heard. The three kicks are listed, the last one heard first.
4. Hear the first kick you heard again, at the bottom of the list. The list
   holds still while you listen. Choose Recently heard again: that kick is now
   at the top.
5. Press 3 to go back to the instrument view without inserting anything, and
   reload the page.
6. Press the slot again and choose Recently heard. The same kicks are there in
   the same order.
7. Select one and press Insert. The editor goes back to the instrument view,
   and the slot names that kick.

**Outcome:** a sound a producer passed over is one click away when they change
their mind, even after a reload.

**Out of scope:** how many sounds the list keeps, which is unit-tested. Recently
heard on another device or browser, which it deliberately doesn't follow
(per-device by decision). Sounds heard through Browse packs' "Hear it", which
plays a pack, not a sound, and is left out at the component layer.

### CF-034 — A producer asks the assistant for a dustier kick, tries it in the beat, and keeps it

**Issue:** GRV-23 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-034.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:**
the project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in with no projects. The assistant is answered by the
suite's scripted provider (#69). Asked for a dustier kick, it recommends the
pack the starter kick comes from, Core Electronic Drums, with up to three of
its kicks that the project does not use yet, the grittiest first, for the BD
track. The library holds at least one such kick.

1. Create a new project. It opens on the arrangement, with the starter kick on
   the drum machine's "BD" pad.
2. Press the Cue button, type "The kick is too clean. Anything dustier?"
   and press Enter. Your message appears in the conversation, and the
   assistant's reply follows it.
3. The reply ends with a recommended pack. It names the pack, its publisher,
   its version and how many sounds it holds, says in a line why it fits, and
   says the pack is already in this project. It lists up to three kicks, each
   with a button to hear it, and offers to try the first on BD. Nothing has
   changed: there is nothing to undo.
4. Press Try on BD. The editor goes to the instrument view, where BD's sample
   slot is. The card says BD is trying the first kick it listed, and the slot
   still names the sound it had: a sound being tried is heard, not saved.
   There is still nothing to undo.
5. Press Put back. The editor goes back to the arrangement, the card says BD's
   own sound is back, and there is nothing to undo.
6. Press Try on BD again, then Keep. The card says the kick was kept, and BD's
   sample slot names it.
7. Undo once. The slot names the starter kick again. Redo once. It names the
   kept kick.
8. Reload the page. BD's sample slot still names the kept kick.

**Outcome:** a producer asked for a sound in words, heard the assistant's pick
in their own beat before anything changed, walked away from it without a trace,
then kept it as one step they can undo, and it is still there when they come
back.

**Out of scope:** what the assistant says, and whether a real model recommends
anything that fits, which `AI-005` evaluates. That trying, hearing a sound and
the pack demo are *audible*: no headless browser records audio. Open in
library, a pack the project does not use yet, a recommendation naming a pack or
sound the library does not hold, and a card that goes out of date under an
edit, which are tested at the component and unit layers, as are the outlines on
the slot. Proposals of changes, which are CF-027's.

### CF-035 — A new producer meets Cue and opens the studio

**Issue:** GRV-25 · **Suite:** `tests/e2e/emulator/flows/CF-035.spec.ts` · **Entrypoint:**
the project dashboard

**Preconditions:** signed in as an invited producer who has never been through
onboarding, with no projects.

1. Open the dashboard. You are taken to the welcome instead: Cue introduces
   itself under its name, and asks what music you love, with genres to pick
   and a box for the artists you love. "Skip to the studio" is on screen.
2. Pick House and Techno, type "Four Tet" in the box, and send. Your answer
   appears in the conversation, and Cue asks how much music you have made.
3. Pick "Played around". Cue asks whether you have a goal.
4. Skip that question. Cue asks what you would like to learn.
5. Pick "Drums and beats" and send. Cue asks about gear.
6. Pick "Ableton Move" and send. A "Saved to memory" card lists what you
   said: House, Techno, Four Tet, Played around, Drums and beats and Ableton
   Move. Its box to share your answers is unticked. Cue offers a first lesson.
7. Choose Open the studio. A new project opens on the arrangement, with Cue's
   panel open and the same conversation in it: your answers, and Cue's offer
   of a first lesson.
8. Reload the page. The conversation is still in Cue's panel.
9. Open the dashboard. It stays on the dashboard, and lists the project.

**Outcome:** a new producer told Cue about themselves once, in a conversation
that carried on into their first project, and is not asked again.

**Out of scope:** what Cue says after onboarding, and whether a real model uses
the memory well, which `AI-005` evaluates. Skipping the whole welcome, the
Memory page, proposing and undoing a memory note, the daily nudge, and the
consented validation event, which are tested at the component and unit layers.
Starting the lesson itself (GRV-43).
