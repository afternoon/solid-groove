# The assistant gateway

The assistant reaches its model provider (Anthropic, ADR 0006) through one
callable Cloud Function, `assistantTurn` (#69). The browser never holds the
provider's API key or talks to the provider directly.

## How it works

- `functions/src/index.ts` exports `assistantTurn`, a streaming callable in
  `us-east1`. Firebase verifies the caller's ID token; the gateway
  (`src/assistant/gateway.ts`) then refuses a guest, parses the request
  against ADR 0007's allowlist, calls the provider and streams the reply.
- The API key is the Secret Manager secret **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**
  (`ASSISTANT_API_KEY_SECRET` in `src/assistant/config.ts`), bound to
  `assistantTurn` alone.
- The model, and how its request is shaped, are configuration in
  `src/assistant/config.ts`. Switching between `claude-sonnet-5` and
  `claude-haiku-4-5` is a change to `ASSISTANT_MODEL_ID` and a deploy.
- Each turn logs one `assistant turn` record to Cloud Logging: outcome code,
  model, prompt version, attempts, failure kinds, token counts, duration.
  Never the conversation, the project, the account or the provider's error
  text.

## Limits and the kill switch

ADR 0006 decisions 4 to 7. Every figure is in `ASSISTANT_LIMITS` in
`src/assistant/config.ts`, alongside the 30-day transcript retention window.

- **Per account: 100 requests in a rolling 24 hours.** Every provider call
  counts, retries included, so the number can be higher than the messages a
  producer sent. Kept in `assistantUsage/{uid}` as the times of the recent
  calls. Over the cap, the call fails with `resource-exhausted` and
  `details.resetsAt`, the time the oldest request leaves the window.
- **Organisation-wide: $25 per UTC day.** Each call's cost is estimated from
  the provider's token counts and the configured prices and added to
  `assistantSpend/{YYYY-MM-DD}` (in micro-dollars). At the ceiling every call
  fails with `unavailable` and `details.code: "spend_ceiling_reached"` until
  midnight UTC. Compare against the Anthropic console's usage page now and
  then: the figure is an estimate.
- **The kill switch.** To stop the assistant at once, with no deploy: in the
  Firebase console, Firestore, create (or edit) the document
  `assistantControl/settings` with a boolean field `enabled` set to `false`.
  Every call then fails with `details.code: "assistant_disabled"` before
  reaching the provider. Set it back to `true`, or delete the document, to
  turn it on again. A missing document means on.
- Clients cannot read or write any of the three collections
  (`firestore.rules`); only the function, with the admin credential, does.
- To give one account a fresh allowance (a tester hit the cap during a
  session you asked for), delete its `assistantUsage/{uid}` document.

## Before the first deploy that includes `assistantTurn`

`main` deploys functions on every merge (`bun run deploy` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). A function that binds a secret cannot deploy
until the secret exists, so do these **before merging** the PR that adds the
gateway, or the next `main` deploy fails:

1. **Create the secret.** With the Firebase CLI signed in as a project owner:

   ```bash
   firebase functions:secrets:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --project <project-id>
   ```

   Paste the Anthropic API key when prompted. This enables the Secret Manager
   API if it is not already on. Use a key from an Anthropic workspace whose
   spend limit you are comfortable with as a last line of defence.

2. **Let the deploy account bind it.** The deploy grants the functions'
   runtime service account access to the secret, so the service account in
   `FIREBASE_DEPLOY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` needs the **Secret Manager Admin** role
   (`roles/secretmanager.admin`) in the project's IAM page. Without it the
   deploy fails with a permission error on the secret.

3. **Merge.** The `deploy` job deploys `assistantTurn` with the rest.

To check it is live: Cloud Functions in the Google Cloud console lists
`assistantTurn` in `us-east1`, with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` under its secrets.

## Rotating the key

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --project <project-id>
firebase deploy --only functions:assistantTurn --project <project-id>
```

A function reads the secret version it was deployed with, so the redeploy is
what picks up the new key. Then disable the old key in the Anthropic console.

## Running it locally

The emulator loads `assistantTurn` without a key, and with no key it answers
from a scripted provider (`src/assistant/emulatorProvider.ts`): a short reply
streamed in pieces, or, by a marker in your message, a reply that hangs until
you press Stop (`[hang]`), one that fails once and then works (`[flaky]`), or
one that ends in a proposal (`[propose]`), or one that ends in a question for
you with options (`[ask]`, `[ask-multi]` for several picks, or `[ask-rich]`
for options that point at the first track and bars 1-2, can be heard, and
answer themselves when you set the tempo to 100 BPM or below; GRV-42). The
browser suite drives the real
gateway that way. To try it against the real provider, put
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` in `functions/.secret.local` (gitignored by
`*.local`) and restart the emulators. The automated suites never use a key:
the unit suites script the provider (`src/testing/scriptedAssistantProvider.ts`)
and the browser suite uses the emulator's.
