// The generated bridge between the library pipeline and the application.
//
// `CNT-001`'s fourth acceptance criterion is that "runtime and tests consume
// generated manifests rather than hand-maintained duplicate lists". Before this
// task the app's "New Project" starter carried its own copy of an asset — a
// name, a storage path, a duration, a sample rate, a channel count, and an
// invented pack — none of which the library pipeline knew about, and one of
// which ("909 Bass Drum") was a brand name the manifest validator rejects.
//
// This module removes the duplicate rather than adding a second one: it selects
// a few assets *by catalogue ID* out of the same builders `buildAllPacks` uses,
// and emits them as a committed TypeScript module the app imports. The audio it
// writes is the same content-addressed object the bucket serves, at the same
// key, so the app resolves a real library asset in dev, in the browser suites,
// and in production alike.
//
// Only the selected assets are rendered. A dev server must not pay for the
// whole 200-asset library to start, and rendering the selection through the
// same `buildAsset`/`buildLoop` functions means there is no second code path
// whose output could drift — `runtime.test.mjs` pins that the committed module
// matches a fresh emit.
