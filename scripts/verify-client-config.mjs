// Fails the build when the deployed client bundle carries no Firebase client
// configuration.
//
// Why this exists: `src/firebaseConfig.ts` reads `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_*`
// and falls back to `undefined` outside mock mode, so a build with those
// variables unset succeeds, passes `verify:bundle`, and deploys cleanly -- and
// then every Auth call fails in the browser with `auth/invalid-api-key`,
// rendering the app's error boundary instead of the page. That happened on
// d65077c: the deploy job reported success and shipped an app that could not
// start a session. Only the post-deploy smoke test caught it, after the broken
// build was already live.
//
// A missing build-time constant is a build defect, not a runtime one, so it
// should fail before `firebase deploy` runs rather than after. This runs in
// `predeploy` (see package.json), between `build` and `verify:bundle`.
//
// Deliberately narrow: it asserts the *presence and shape* of values Vite
// inlined into the bundle. It cannot tell a valid API key from a revoked one --
// that is the post-deploy smoke test's job, and the two are complementary.
//
// It reads *minified* output, so it must not assume how the minifier spells
// things. Vite 8's rolldown/oxc minifier writes string literals with backticks
// where esbuild wrote double quotes, and this check -- which matched only
// double quotes -- then reported all four fields "not present in the bundle"
// on a preview build whose config was complete and correct. Nothing was wrong
// with the build; the assertion was. A shape assertion over minified code is
// only as honest as the range of shapes it accepts, which is also why this
// file now has a test that feeds it both spellings.
