/**
 * The standing pool of QA accounts CI signs into the live app as (#1055).
 *
 * Guest start is retired (#854), so the scheduled QA sweep and the post-deploy
 * smoke test sign in as real, allowlisted accounts instead. They are ordinary
 * users with a verified address on a domain that receives no mail; what makes
 * them reachable from CI is that a service account signs a Firebase custom
 * token for one of them (`tests/e2e/hosted/qaSession.ts`). Nothing here is in
 * the app's bundle: only the provisioning script and the hosted suites import
 * it.
 *
 * - Slot 0 belongs to the post-deploy smoke test.
 * - Slots 1 to 10 belong to the sweep: agent *n* signs in as slot *n*, so
 *   agents stay out of each other's projects. Ten is the sweep's agent ceiling
 *   (`MAX_AGENTS` in `scripts/qa-sweep/sweep.mjs`).
 *
 * Like the rest of `src/access`, this imports nothing from Firebase: the
 * script supplies the Admin SDK as a {@link QaUserStore}, and the tests a map.
