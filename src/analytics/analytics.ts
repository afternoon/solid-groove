// The product-analytics logging boundary (PRD `OPS-02`).
//
// Every analytics call in the application goes through this object. It is the
// only thing that talks to an `AnalyticsTransport`, and it is what makes the
// catalog's guarantees true at runtime:
//
// - **Enrichment.** Release SHA and surface are attached to every event;
//   account type and internal-traffic are set as GA4 user properties. Callers
//   never pass them, so they cannot be forgotten or set to something else.
// - **Validation.** The payload is re-checked against the catalog and an event
//   that fails is dropped rather than sent partially — a half-populated event
//   silently corrupts the section 11 measures.
// - **Consent.** Nothing is sent while the user has opted out.
// - **Fail-open.** A blocked, failing, or absent transport is swallowed. PRD
//   `OPS-02`: it "never breaks playback, editing, saving, or export, and never
//   surfaces an error to the user."
// - **Once-only events.** `first_edit` and `feature_first_use` fire once per
//   project / per account respectively, across reloads.
