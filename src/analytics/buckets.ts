// "Counts and durations are bucketed rather than exact, so a rare exact
// combination cannot re-identify a session." This module owns every bucket
// scale the catalog uses. A `*_bucket` parameter's allowed values are exactly
// one scale's labels, so `src/analytics/catalog.ts` names a scale rather than
// repeating a list of strings, and a caller cannot invent a label.
//
// Labels are part of the published analytics contract: they end up in Google
// Analytics reports and in saved explorations. Renaming one silently splits a
// metric across two labels for the same behavior, so treat a change here the
// same way as a change to an event name — as a contract change.
