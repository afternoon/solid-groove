/**
 * Our own published packs, as `pack_id` values (PRD LIB-05, LOOP-013, LIB-08).
 *
 * `pack_id` is a pack's stable **slug** — never its display name, never its
 * `pak_` ID. This list is *not* the parameter's whole value set: a third-party
 * pack is published into the library out of band, so no table compiled into the
 * app can enumerate every legitimate slug, and `pack_id` is a
 * {@link SlugParam} that admits any published slug by shape (see
 * `packAnalyticsIdentity`, which decides whether a given pack's slug may travel
 * at all).
 *
 * What the list still buys is a decision point for *our* catalogue: a factory
 * pack shipped without an analytics decision fails `catalog.test.ts` rather than
 * quietly appearing in reports, and the frozen slugs document what a saved GA4
 * exploration of the first-party library can rely on.
