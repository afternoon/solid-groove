 * double-click, or `Enter` on a selected clip), `slot` is pressing a sample
 * slot, which aims the Library at it, `empty_screen` is the fix button on
 * a view that had nothing to show, and `library_insert` is the Library's
 * Insert button, which inserts and goes back (`UI-002`). `reveal` is the
