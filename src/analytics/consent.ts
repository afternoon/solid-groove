// Telemetry consent (PRD `OPS-02` / section 10 Security and privacy).
//
// "The user is told what is collected and can decline product analytics
// without losing any DAW or assistant capability." This module owns the
// *mechanism*: a persisted, observable preference that the analytics boundary
// and the error-reporting boundary both consult before they send anything.
//
// It deliberately owns neither the default nor the wording. `DEC-009` decides
// whether collection is on by default with an opt-out or requires opt-in, what
// the disclosure says, how long data is retained, and any regional constraint.
// Both are isolated to `CONSENT_DEFAULT` and `src/components/TelemetryDisclosure.tsx`
// so settling `DEC-009` is a one-line change here plus copy, not a redesign.
//
// Three collections, three flags: Google Analytics for product events, Sentry
// for error monitoring (ADR 0001), and Sentry Session Replay for understanding
// how the app is used (ADR 0002). They are separate because `DEC-009` may
// decide differently about a reliability signal that keeps a release gate
// honest, about product analytics, and about a sampled recording of an
// interaction — which is more sensitive per record than a counter. The alpha's
// disclosure surface presents them as one choice; the model does not force that.
