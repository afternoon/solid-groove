// Stable error codes and areas (PRD `OPS-02` / `OPS-03`).
//
// These are *analytics parameter values*, so they live with the catalog rather
// than with the reporting boundary that consumes them: `exception`,
// `save_failed`, `audio_start_failed`, `asset_load_failed`, and `export_failed`
// all carry an `error_code` drawn from one list, and `exception` carries an
// `area`. `src/monitoring` imports from here; nothing here imports monitoring.
//
// A code is a *stable, low-cardinality, human-meaningful* classification, not a
// message. It answers "which failure is this" well enough to alert on and to
// group in a report; the exact detail lives in Sentry, attached to a stack
// trace. Codes are append-only for the same reason event names are: changing
// one splits a metric across two values for the same failure.
