// Pack identity as an analytics value (PRD `OPS-02`, LIB-05, LIB-08).
//
// "Which packs are most popular?" needs an event that names *which* pack was
// added, not only what sort of pack it was — and it needs that answer for
// third-party packs above all, since the point of measuring adoption is to feed
// it back to the people who publish packs (LIB-06's marketplace: internal
// reporting, plus validation for a third-party creator that their pack landed).
//
// The privacy line is drawn by **publication**, not by authorship:
//
//   - a **factory** pack is content we publish;
//   - a **third-party** pack is content someone else publishes *through* us —
//     it appears in the public pack index, under a slug we serve, and is by
//     definition shareable;
//   - a **user** pack is not published at all. It is one producer's own
//     content, and a user pack that becomes shareable becomes a third-party
//     pack first, at which point it has a published slug like any other. So a
//     user pack's slug never travels: it reports the `"user"` sentinel.
//
// That rule is structural rather than a habit each call site has to remember —
// {@link packAnalyticsIdentity} takes the pack's *published index entry* and is
// the only way to build the parameters, so a caller cannot pass a slug without
// also passing the kind that authorizes it.
//
// The identifier is the pack's stable **slug** (`scripts/starter-library/
// packs.mjs` for ours; the pack index's `slug` for a third party's), never its
// display name and never its `pak_` ID: a GA4 breakdown reads as
// `foundation-bass` rather than an opaque token, a rename cannot rewrite
// analytics history, and library copy never lands in a report.
