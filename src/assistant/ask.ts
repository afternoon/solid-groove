/**
 * The assistant's one non-command tool (GRV-42): `ask_producer`, a question
 * with options, the way an agent harness asks its operator.
 *
 * The model calls it like any tool, beside the proposal tools in `tools.ts`,
 * but it changes nothing: the gateway takes the call out of the turn's tool
 * calls and returns it as the turn's {@link AssistantAsk}, and the panel shows
 * it above the composer until the producer answers or dismisses it. The
 * answer is the next turn's user message ({@link answerMessage}).
 *
 * The provider is stateless and the conversation is resent as plain text
 * (`history.ts`), so the question itself travels in that text too: the
 * assistant's turn is resent with {@link askTranscript} after its reply, and
 * the model reads its own question back beside the answer.
 *
 * An option can carry more than words: a part of the song it is about
 * ({@link AskReference}: a track, a clip or a bar range, which the editor
 * highlights while the option is hovered and selects when it is picked), a
 * sound to hear ({@link AskSound}: a track's instrument, or a preview of
 * changes the assistant could make), and a predicate on the project
 * ({@link AskPredicate}) that answers the question as that option when the
 * producer makes the change in the editor instead of picking.
 *
 * The tool never writes memory. An answer reaches memory only when the
 * assistant then proposes a memory note from it (GRV-25).
 *
 * Like the rest of `src/assistant`, Firebase-free and SDK-free.
