/**
 * The assistant gateway's configuration (#69, ADR 0006 decisions 2 and 7).
 *
 * Every number the gateway, its limits and the copy that describes them need
 * is written down here and nowhere else: which model answers, how each model
 * wants its request shaped, how long one provider call may take, how often a
 * failed one is retried, and how much conversation is resent per turn.
 * Switching models is a change to {@link ASSISTANT_MODEL_ID} and nothing else
 * (ADR 0006 decision 2: the product owner's call, from dogfooding).
 *
 * Like `src/domain`, this module imports nothing from Firebase, Tone or Solid,
 * and nothing from the provider's SDK: the Cloud Function
 * (`functions/src/index.ts`, over `functions/src/assistantHandler.ts` and
 * `functions/src/anthropicProvider.ts`) is the only place that touches either.
