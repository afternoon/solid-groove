/**
 * What Cue remembers about the producer, as a turn carries it, and the one
 * tool that proposes adding to it (GRV-25).
 *
 * **Reading.** A turn may carry the producer's memory (their onboarding
 * answers and the notes they confirmed, `src/persistence/profileDocuments.ts`)
 * beside the project. The system prompt puts it in front of the model before
 * every reply and asks it to say so when it uses it. It is the producer's own
 * words about themselves, sent only to the provider that answers them; it is
 * never in a project and never in analytics.
 *
 * **Writing.** Memory is never written silently. `remember_producer` proposes
 * one thing to remember, a note in the producer's words or a new value for
 * one of the six fields; the gateway passes the call back among the turn's
 * calls (as it does `recommend_sounds`), the panel takes it out
 * ({@link splitMemoryProposals}) and shows it as a card, and only the
 * producer's confirmation saves it, with a receipt and Undo.
 *
 * **Asking later.** A question the producer skipped in onboarding may be
 * named in `askLater`. The model may ask it once, when the conversation makes
 * it relevant, with `ask_producer` and its `memoryQuestion`, which tells the
 * browser it has been asked.
 *
 * Firebase-free and SDK-free, like the rest of `src/assistant`.
