/**
 * Applying, cancelling and undoing an assistant proposal (GRV-4, PRD AI-03).
 *
 * The executor goes through the editor session a manual edit goes through
 * (see {@link ProposalTarget}); it adds no mutation path of its own. `propose` validates the model's response
 * (`proposal.ts`) and hands back a {@link ProposalHandle}:
 *
 * - `apply()` executes the proposal's commands as one transaction, as the
 *   `assistant` actor and pinned to the revision the proposal was validated
 *   against: one revision, one history entry, or no change at all. A project
 *   that moved in the meantime makes the proposal `stale`; it can be
 *   cancelled, never applied.
 * - `cancel()` changes nothing.
 * - `undo()` replays the entry's inverse through the history, but only while
 *   the proposal is still the newest entry, so it can never undo someone
 *   else's edit by mistake.
 * - `followHistory()` is told when the history undid or redid the proposal's
 *   entry by some other way (the header's Undo, a shortcut), so the handle
 *   stays in step: an undo from anywhere is logged as one, and a redo makes
 *   the proposal undoable again.
 *
 * Each step logs its `assistant_proposal_*` event through the injected
 * analytics, with the proposal's capability, a bucketed command count and,
 * for a decision or an undo, a bucketed time. The intent, the summaries and
 * the payloads never go near it.
