 * ({@link "../testing/scriptedAssistantProvider"}). Neither ever reaches the
 * browser or project state.
 *
 * A provider yields the stream's **raw wire events** (the Messages API's
 * server-sent events, parsed from JSON). Interpreting and validating them is
 * the gateway's job (`streamEvents.ts`), so a scripted provider exercises the
