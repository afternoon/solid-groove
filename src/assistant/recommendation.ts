/**
 * Recommending a pack and its sounds from the library (GRV-23).
 *
 * A recommendation is not a change to the song, so it is not one of the
 * command tools in `tools.ts`: the model calls {@link RECOMMEND_SOUNDS_TOOL}
 * with a pack ID, up to three of that pack's sound IDs, a line on why they fit
 * and the track (on a drum machine, the pad) to try them on. The tool is offered only on a turn that
 * carries the published library (`AssistantTurnRequest.library`), so the model
 * has the IDs to choose from.
 *
 * The gateway returns its calls among the turn's other tool calls; the browser
 * takes them out of the proposal ({@link splitRecommendations}) and checks
 * each against the library it sent ({@link validateRecommendation}). An ID the
 * library does not hold is refused, never shown: the assistant may only
 * recommend what the app can actually play and insert.
 *
 * Trying a recommended sound is audio only, and keeping one goes through the
 * library's own insertion (`src/editor/assistant`), so nothing here touches a
 * project. Like the rest of `src/assistant`, it imports no Firebase and no SDK.
