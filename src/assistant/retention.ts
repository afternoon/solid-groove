/**

 * it, deletes everything on a no, and answers the `assistantRetention`
 * callable. Firebase-free, over a {@link TranscriptStore}; the Cloud Functions
 * (`functions/src/retentionHandler.ts`, `functions/src/index.ts`) supply the
 * Firestore store, and the mock backend an in-memory one.
 *
 * Nothing here logs or reports what a transcript says. Keeping one is never
 * allowed to fail the turn it records: the assistant behaves the same whether
 * or not anything is kept.
