/**
 * The assistant's tool schema (GRV-4, PRD AI-03 and AI-05).
 *
 * The assistant changes a project only through shared commands, and only
 * through the allowlisted subset below. Each tool is one registered command:
 * its name is the command type with `_` for `.`, its input schema is generated
 * from the command's own Zod payload schema, and a call is turned back into
 * that command with the registered version pinned. Nothing here applies a
 * command — `proposal.ts` validates a set of calls and `proposalExecutor.ts`
 * hands them to the command history as one transaction.
 *
 * ## Appendix A families and the commands that carry them
 *
 * The PRD's Appendix A named the families the allowlist should cover before
 * the command layer existed, so its names are not the registry's. Each family
 * maps onto a capability key (the `capability` analytics parameter) and the
 * registered commands that do its job:
 *
 * | Appendix A family                     | Capability   | Commands |
 * | ------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
 * | `project.setTempo`                    | `tempo`      | `parameter.set` on `song.tempo` and `song.swing` (the groove's timing, GRV-5) only |
 * | `track.add/update/move/duplicate/remove` | `tracks`  | `track.create`, `track.update`, `track.reorder`, `track.delete` |
 * | `clip.add/update/duplicate/remove`    | `clips`      | `clip.create`, `clip.update`, `clip.delete` |
 * | `note.add/update/transform/remove`    | `notes`      | `note.*` and every `notes.*` transform |
 * | `placement.add/update/duplicate/remove` | `placements` | `placement.create`, `placement.update`, `placement.delete` |
 * | `instrument.set/setParameter`         | `instrument` | `instrument.change`, `instrument.setSample`, `drum.setPadAsset`, `drum.setPadParameter`, `parameter.set` on an instrument |
 * | `device.add/update/move/duplicate/remove` | `devices` | `device.add/remove/reorder/duplicate/setBypass/reset`, `parameter.set` on a device in any chain |
 * | `send.setLevel`, `return.add/update/remove` | `returns` | `return.create/update/delete`, `send.add/remove`, `parameter.set` on a send or a return |
 * | `mixer.setParameter`                  | `mixer`      | `parameter.set` on a track strip or the master, `track.setFlag` (mute, solo) |
 * | `transaction.apply`                   | —            | Every proposal is one transaction; a proposal spanning capabilities reports `mixed` |
 * | `section.add/update/move/remove`      | —            | No section command exists yet |
 * | `automation.addLane/setPoints/transform/removeLane` | — | No automation command exists yet |
 *
 * A `duplicate` is a create with new IDs (the command layer has no separate
 * duplicate for tracks, clips or placements; `device.duplicate` is the one
 * that exists). Section and automation commands are a contract change of their
 * own, so until they land those families are absent and their lanes cannot be
 * slipped in through a create's restore fields either (see `refuse` below).
 *
 * Commands the assistant may not call at all are pinned in
 * {@link NON_ASSISTANT_COMMANDS}, so a newly registered command needs a
 * decision here before the tests pass.
