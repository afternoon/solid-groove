/**
 * `resume()`'s own logic — call `Tone.start()` only when needed, wait out an
 * in-flight `close()`, and mark the runtime running — is independent of
 * whether a live `AudioContext` actually completes its browser resume
 * handshake. Tested here against a fake Tone module instead of the real one:
 * `AudioRuntime.test.ts` already covers `ensureContext()`/`close()` against a
 * genuine Tone context (reliable in this environment), but a live
 * `AudioContext.resume()` depends on an audio callback this sandbox has no
 * device to fire — see the comment at the top of that file.
