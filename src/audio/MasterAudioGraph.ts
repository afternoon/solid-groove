 *
 * The order depends on that choice. With the safety limiter, it is
 * `mix -> chain -> volume -> limiter`, exactly as every project made before
 * #937 has always sounded. Without it, the volume comes first,
 * `mix -> volume -> chain`: the chain's trailing Limiter is then the last
 * thing the signal meets, so raising the master fader (up to +6 dB) drives
 * into the Limiter rather than past it, and the Limiter's own loudness
 * readout is of what plays and exports.
 * There is exactly one of these per {@link ProjectAudioGraph} and it is never
 * rebuilt for a routine edit — only its device chain and volume are reconciled
 * in place, so a parameter edit never restarts the transport or reconstructs
 * the meter/limiter.
