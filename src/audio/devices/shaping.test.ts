/**
 * Renders a fixed oscillator through one device node and returns the mono
 * channel.
 *
 * The waveform matters, and the two used here are chosen deliberately:
 *
 * - A **sine** at a moderate level is the probe for *distortion*. It carries
 *   almost no high-frequency energy of its own, so every harmonic `hfEnergy`
 *   reports is one the device added — which makes the measurement a claim
 *   about the transfer curve rather than about the source.
 * - A **sawtooth** is the probe for *filtering*. It has energy at every
 *   harmonic, so a cutoff moving up or down changes `hfEnergy` monotonically.
 *
 * Using a sawtooth to measure distortion (the first thing tried here) does not
 * work: it is already harmonically dense and near full scale, so it clips at
 * every drive setting and the measurement barely moves.
