/**
 * Asset lifecycle commands (PRD LIB-05, invariant 12).
 *
 * A project stores a *reference* to a library sound, not the library record, so
 * putting a sound on a track is two things: the project has to carry the asset,
 * and something has to point at it. These commands own the first half; the
 * pointer is `instrument.setSample`, `drum.setPadAsset`, or an audio-loop clip.
 * Both halves go in one transaction, which is what makes "drag a sound onto a
 * sampler" one undoable step rather than two.
 *
 * Three things fall out of the kernel rather than being restated here:
 *
 * - **Pack dependencies stay derived.** Neither command touches
 *   `metadata.packDependencies` or the shelf; `executeTransaction` recomputes
 *   both from `song.assets` once per transaction (`withDerivedPackDependencies`),
 *   so adding the first sound from a pack shelves that pack atomically with the
 *   edit that needed it.
 * - **Nothing dangles.** `asset.remove` refuses an asset a track's instrument, a
 *   drum pad, or an audio-loop clip still resolves, naming what holds it, rather
 *   than letting the transaction fail later as a broken project.
 * - **Undo restores position.** `song.assets` is serialized in order, so
 *   removal's inverse puts the asset back at the index it came from instead of
 *   appending it and calling the project equal.
