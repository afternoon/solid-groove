/**
 * Pack-shelf commands (LIB-08).
 *
 * The shelf (`metadata.addedPacks`) is the "packs the user has added to this
 * project" list, distinct from the *derived* `packDependencies` ("packs the
 * project uses"). It is the one piece of pack state a command maintains rather
 * than derives, because adding a pack the user has not yet drawn a sound from
 * has to survive a reload — deriving the shelf from usage would make that pack
 * vanish.
 *
 * Two rules make these commands safe against the derived list:
 *
 * - `pack.add` shelves a pack at a version. If the pack is already shelved at
 *   the same version it is a no-op error (nothing to undo); at a *different*
 *   version it is refused, because a project shelves one version per pack.
 * - `pack.remove` refuses to unshelve a pack the project still uses, so a used
 *   pack is never silently dropped from the panel while its sounds play. The
 *   caller resolves the assets first (or the pack surfaces as a missing-pack
 *   state via `resolvePackAvailability`); the command does not do it for them.
 *
 * Neither command touches `song.assets`, so neither changes `packDependencies`.
 *
 * `pack.setVersion` (#892) is the one pack command that does: it moves the
 * project's pin for one pack from one version to another — every asset the
 * project carries from that pack, and its shelf entry, together. Assets are
 * immutable content, so the sounds themselves do not change; only the version
 * the project resolves them from does. It is how a project pinned to an older
 * version takes a sound from a newer one, in the same transaction as the
 * insert, and its inverse (the same command, versions swapped) is how one undo
 * puts the old pin back. It refuses a pin the project does not hold, so it can
 * never leave a pack at two versions.
