/**
 * The one dialog shell (`UI-001`).
 *
 * The editor grew three of these independently — the sequence editor, the
 * library, and the pack browser — and they disagreed about everything a
 * producer can see: three backdrops at three z-indexes, three paddings, three
 * corner radii, and three different ways to get out (a header ✕, a footer
 * button, and a click on the scrim). That is not a style problem. A dialog is
 * a thing the app interrupts you with, and if each one interrupts differently
 * you have to read it before you can dismiss it.
 *
 * So the chrome lives here and the contents stay theirs. What every dialog
 * now shares:
 *
 * - **A way out that is always the same.** A close button, a scrim you can
 *   click, and `Escape` — which the surface registers through the shortcut
 *   registry (`view.close_surface`), never its own listener.
 * - **The scrim is a real button.** "Click outside to dismiss" is otherwise a
 *   mouse-only affordance; as a button it is one accessible thing, kept out
 *   of the tab order because the close button is the keyboard path.
 * - **Focus goes in and comes back.** The close button takes focus on open,
 *   and whatever opened the dialog gets it back on close, so a keyboard does
 *   not get dropped at the top of the document.
