 * The home page's markup and copy, with no behaviour of its own (#1135).
 *
 * Split out of `LandingPage.tsx` so the same tree can be rendered from two
 * places: the interactive page the client mounts, and the prerendered document
 * shell (`src/Document.tsx`), which is SSR-transformed at build time. Keeping
 * it props-only is what makes the second one possible — the shell must not
 * reach the analytics, auth, or consent module graphs, and this component
 * imports none of them.
 *
 * It is also the single copy of the copy: a claim edited here changes the
 * prerendered HTML and the live page together, so the two can never drift.
 *
 * ## Honesty is a requirement here, not a tone
 *
 * `PRJ-06`: the page "does not advertise capabilities beyond the current
 * milestone". The AI producer is the one capability on it that has not
 * shipped, and every mention of it is labelled with when it arrives
 * (`AI_PRODUCER_ARRIVES`) and shown as a design study, not a screenshot.
 * The four `STUDIO_ROWS` are what the alpha does today, each pictured by a
 * real screenshot `bun run landing:capture` records from the app; a row that
 * stops being true is edited here and re-recorded there.

 * JavaScript has loaded, opens in a new tab on a middle-click, and is visible
 * to a crawler that does not execute scripts.

 * "Sign in" stays a `<button>`: it opens an identity-provider popup and goes
 * nowhere on its own, so it is an action, not a destination.
