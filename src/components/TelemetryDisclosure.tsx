/**
 * The user-facing disclosure and opt-out (PRD `OPS-02`, section 10 Security
 * and privacy).
 *
 * "The user is told what is collected and can decline product analytics
 * without losing any DAW or assistant capability." Turning this off stops
 * collection and changes nothing else — there is no capability behind it,
 * which `src/telemetry.test.ts` asserts by running the core journey (edit,
 * save, undo) with collection disabled and both transports throwing, and
 * comparing the result against the same journey with telemetry working.
 *
 * ## What this task does and does not decide
 *
 * `FND-001c` owns the mechanism: a persisted preference, an accessible
 * control, and a disclosure naming both processors. `DEC-009` owns the
 * *default state* (see `CONSENT_DEFAULT`) and the *final wording*. The copy
 * below is deliberately plain and factual so it is accurate as written, and it
 * is isolated here so settling `DEC-009` is a copy change in one file.
 *
 * `LOOP-001b` gives this surface its designed home in the landing page footer
 * (`placement="inline"`) per `DEC-009`. Everywhere else it floats as app chrome
 * (`placement="floating"`, the default), so the opt-out stays reachable from
 * the dashboard, the editor, and the error screen. `FloatingTelemetryDisclosure`
 * stands the floating copy down while an inline one is mounted, so a page never
 * carries two — which would also duplicate this component's element ids.
 */

/**
 * Whether a page is currently rendering its own inline copy of the disclosure.
 *
 * `FloatingTelemetryDisclosure` reads this to decide whether the app-chrome
 * copy is needed. Presence, not the route, is the thing that matters: the
 * landing page hosts its own, but only once its chunk has mounted and only
 * while it is rendering, so a route-based rule would leave `/` with no opt-out
 * on the error screen and while the page is still loading — exactly the
 * situations the floating copy exists for (PRD `OPS-02`).

					Session Replay records a small sample of sessions — which controls you
					click and how you move around — so we can see where people get stuck
					and fix it. Those recordings include your arrangement and piano roll,

					names you give sections. We record them because that is where the
					problems we need to see actually happen.

					Your conversations with the assistant are stored with your project so
					we can tell whether it is helping. They stay with us — never sent to
