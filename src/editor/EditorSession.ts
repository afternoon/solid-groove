 *
 * Autosave scope is a structural diff of the committed project against the one
 * before it (see {@link queueAutosave}): a changed `song` reference queues the
 * song tier, and each clip that was added, edited, or removed queues that clip
 * document. `LOOP-007` introduced the first UI that edits song structure
 * (tracks and the mixer), so dispatch-to-autosave had to cover the song tier
 * and multi-clip track edits, not just the single clip a note command names.
 * The same diff drives `beginGesture`'s commit path, so a piano-roll note drag
 * and a fader/pan drag share exactly one autosave mechanism.
 *
 * `beginPreview` (UI-005, #851) shows a set of commands applied without
 * committing them; see its own comment for the rules.
