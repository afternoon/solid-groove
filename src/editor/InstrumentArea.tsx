 * One track's instrument controls — the kind picker (#224) and whichever panel
 * that kind gets — inside a single region named for the track.
 *
 * It exists to be a *drop target* (#225). Dragging a sound onto an instrument is
 * how a producer expects to load one, and the target has to be identifiable: a
 * project with several tracks has several of these, so the region is named
 * `"Hats instrument"` rather than `"Sampler"`, and a drop lands on a particular
 * track. The panels inside keep their own names (`"Sampler"`, `"Synth voice"`),
 * which is what lets the picker's own region stay simply `"Instrument"`.
 *
 * The whole area is the target rather than the sampler panel alone, for two
 * reasons: the gesture does not require hitting a small strip, and a `drop` does
 * not travel *down* the tree — landing on the picker at the top of the area
 * would otherwise reach no handler at all.
 *
 * Only a sampler takes a sound. A drag over a synth or drum-machine track is
 * left to the browser, so it shows no drop cursor and nothing is dispatched.
