/**
 * What the assistant reads and may change (GRV-26): the composer's scope
 * chip, and the project context a turn sends for it.
 *
 * The scope follows the editor:
 *
 * - **your selection**, when there is one: notes selected in the clip on
 *   screen (`clip`), or clips selected in the arrangement (`section`, the
 *   arrangement's stretch of the song: since #292 a band selects the clips it
 *   touches rather than a range);
 * - else **the selected track** (`track`);
 * - or **the whole song** (`song`).
 *
 * One click widens it (selection, then track, then song, and back round),
 * and the choice resets when the selection changes. A selection only counts
 * on the view that shows it, so what the chip says is always what is on
 * screen.
 *
 * The context is the allowlisted payload (`src/assistant/payload.ts`, ADR
 * 0007). Raw note events go only for a selection: the track scope names its
 * track but sends no notes, and the song scope sends neither.
 *
 * Pure, so the rules are tested without rendering.
