/**
 * The suggestion chips above the composer (GRV-26): #70's context-derived
 * next steps (`buildProjectAnalysis`'s `suggestions`), ordered to follow the
 * view on screen and the scope the chip says. Clicking one sends its label
 * as a message.
 *
 * The analysis reads the whole project, so on its own it offers the same
 * chips everywhere. The panel's focused next steps come first: one for the
 * selection when the chip is on it (vary these notes, these clips), and one
 * for the view on screen and the track in scope (develop a part in the
 * arrangement, a fill in the sequence view, the sound in the instrument view,
 * a sound in the library, the balance in the mixer). Widening the chip to the
 * song drops the track's.
 *
 * Then the analysis's: a suggestion whose scope is the chip's own comes
 * first, then one the view is for (the arrangement for structure, the mixer
 * for balance, the clip and instrument views for parts), then the rest in the
 * analysis's own order. Only the first {@link MAX_SHOWN} are shown, so the
 * row never scrolls far.
