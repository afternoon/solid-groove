/**
 * What the assistant tells a producer about what it sends and what Groove
 * keeps (GRV-8): the disclosure's copy, in one place so a wording change is
 * one edit. Approved in ADR 0007 decision 5; the four things it must stay
 * true and specific about are what is sent, what the provider may do with
 * it, what Groove keeps and for how long, and what the control does and does
 * not cover.
 *
 * The retention window is read from the one configured value
 * (`TRANSCRIPT_RETENTION_DAYS`, which the server's expiry reads too), so the
 * copy and the deletion can never disagree.
 *
 * The provider's posture (the second paragraph) is written from Anthropic's
 * published terms, re-read on 2026-10-09 (ADR 0007 decision 6): the
 * commercial terms (effective 17 June 2025) say "Anthropic may not train
 * models on Customer Content from Services"; the commercial retention policy
 * says inputs and outputs are deleted "within 30 days of receipt or
 * generation", and kept "for up to 2 years" when flagged by its trust and
 * safety systems. Re-read them whenever this copy ships again.
