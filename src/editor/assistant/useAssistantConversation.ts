/**
 * The conversation in the assistant's panel (GRV-26): what has been said,
 * the reply streaming now, and the three things a producer can do about it
 * (send, Stop, Try again). Closing the panel keeps it, and with a
 * {@link UseAssistantConversationOptions.persistence} key a reload of the
 * same project brings back what was said and a question still waiting
 * (GRV-42, `conversationStore.ts`).
 *
 * Every turn goes through an {@link AssistantClient}, the one door to the
 * gateway, and each is stamped with the scope it was sent with. Nothing here
 * touches the project: a proposal in a reply is handed to `onProposal`
 * (the proposal card's controller, GRV-5), which is what can apply it.
 *
 * A reply may end in a question for the producer (`ask_producer`, GRV-42).
 * It stays pending, above the composer, until it is answered or dismissed;
 * a message typed meanwhile goes as usual and leaves it pending, so the
 * assistant has both. An answer is the next turn's message, and a newer
 * question takes the place of one still pending.
 *
 * Analytics: `assistant_message_sent` with the scope,
 * `assistant_suggestion_clicked` with the suggestion's ID, and
 * `assistant_ask_shown`/`assistant_ask_answered` with how many options a
 * question had and how it was answered. Never the text of a message, a
 * reply, a question or an answer, and nothing about what is in scope.
