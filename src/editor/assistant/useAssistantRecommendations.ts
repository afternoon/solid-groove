/**
 * The assistant's recommended packs (GRV-23): one card per recommendation a
 * reply makes, and what Try, Keep, Put back, Undo, Pack demo and Open in
 * library do to it. A recommendation is a proposal like any other (GRV-5):
 *
 * - **Try on ‹slot›** plays the first suggested sound through the slot, the
 *   library's hot-swap: an audio-only override with no command, no undo entry
 *   and no save. The editor goes to the view that shows the slot, which gets
 *   the dashed outline, and focus stays on the card.
 * - **Keep** inserts that sound through the library's own insertion, so a pack
 *   the project did not use becomes one of its packs exactly as an Insert in
 *   the library makes it: one transaction, one undo entry. The slot is
 *   outlined as changed until the next edit, and the card offers Undo.
 * - **Put back** drops the override and goes back to where the editor was.
 * - Editing the slot while a sound is being tried, or a change made
 *   elsewhere, puts the sound back and makes the card **stale**: it can ask
 *   again (Refresh) or be dismissed.
 *
 * A recommendation naming a pack or a sound the library does not hold is
 * refused and shown as a failed reply, never as a card.
 *
 * Analytics: `assistant_recommendation_*`, with whether the pack was the
 * project's already and, for a decision, how long it took. Never a pack's or a
 * sound's name, nor what the producer asked.
