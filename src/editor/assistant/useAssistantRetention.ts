/**
 * The account's answer about keeping its assistant conversations (GRV-8),
 * held once per editor beside the conversation.
 *
 * Until a signed-in account has answered the current disclosure, the
 * assistant cannot be messaged: `useAssistantChat` gates sending on
 * {@link AssistantRetention.answered}, and the panel shows the disclosure in
 * place of the composer. An answer the browser could not load counts as no
 * answer, so the disclosure is shown again rather than skipped.
 *
 * Giving an answer logs `assistant_retention_changed` with the answer only,
 * once it is stored. Analytics failing changes nothing here: the answer is
 * stored first, and the event is best-effort after it.
