 *
 * - When the next placement on its track is a full linked copy of the same
 *   clip, starting right where it ends (a right-edge drag tiles those, #493),
 *   the two merge into one placement twice as long. Four one-bar tiles become
 *   two two-bar placements, so the region still plays the whole clip in turn.
 * - Otherwise it grows into free space, stopping at the next placement on its
 *   track: a track's placements never overlap.
 *
 * A looped placement already repeats the clip, and one that stops short of
 * the end shows only part of it, so both stay as they are.
