 *
 * Two outcomes are reported, both non-fatal (the editor shows its own state
 * for each and nothing crashed):
 *
 * - A load that failed for any reason but `not_found`, coded by the
 *   repository's reason and carrying a summary of the decode issues.
 * - A load that succeeded only after dropping references to documents that
 *   were never stored, so a store still being left in that state shows up.
 *
 * The message never carries an issue's own text, which names entity IDs and
 * can quote stored values: only issue codes and the *shape* of where they
 * were found, with indices and IDs reduced to placeholders, plus counts.
