/**
 * Builds a fresh `FND-009` starter project: one drum-machine track ("BD") with
 * a single "BD" pad whose kick resolves through a real factory pack from the
 * generated library manifest (`src/library/factoryLibrary.ts`), and a one-bar
 * four-on-the-floor clip of pad hits placed once (#496: a drum machine is the
 * one-shot player, a sampler the tonal instrument) — the same shape `src/domain/fixtures.ts`'s
 * `createSliceFixtureProject` pins for tests, but with real (non-seeded) IDs
 * and the current time, for "New Project" to hand to the repository. The
 * project is named by `generateProjectName` ("Mood Energy"), not "Untitled".
 * Its master carries a Limiter in place of the hidden safety limiter (#937).
 *
 * This is deliberately the smallest project the `FND-009` 16-step slice needs
 * to be playable immediately, not the richer dashboard creation flow
 * (blank/template/duplicate, genre, etc.) — that is `LOOP-001`'s scope.
