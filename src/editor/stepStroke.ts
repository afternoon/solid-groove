/**
 * The CLP-02 step editor's paint/erase stroke machine.
 *
 * A stroke is one continuous pointer gesture across the grid. It is imperative
 * bookkeeping rather than rendered state, and it is deliberately *not* part of
 * `stepEditorModel.ts`: that module is a pure function of the clip and
 * instrument, whereas this one owns gesture lifetime, command dispatch, and
 * analytics. The component (`StepEditor.tsx`) still owns pointer events and
 * decides *when* a stroke begins, paints, and ends; everything that happens
 * *inside* one lives here so it can be unit-tested without a DOM.
 *
 * Every project mutation still goes through the shared command layer (PRD
 * section 9.6): each painted step applies immediately so audio stays live, but
 * the whole stroke commits as a single history entry and revision (CLP-02
 * "undo groups a single drag gesture").
