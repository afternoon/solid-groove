 * What creating a track produces, and the kinds it can be created as (#223).

 * Track creation used to mint a synth and nothing else, so a sampler or a drum
 * machine could only ever arrive with the starter project or a fixture. Which
 * kinds exist, what each is called, what instrument each mints, and what each
 * reports to analytics are `src/instrument/instrumentKinds.ts`'s to say — the
 * instrument panel's kind picker chooses from the same set, and the two had
 * begun to disagree. What is track creation's alone stays here: the button's
 * accessible name, and the clip and placement a new track opens with.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates a project: it builds the entities a `track.add` command
 * carries, so the mixer's dispatch stays the one mutation path (PRD 9.6).
