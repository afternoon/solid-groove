 * effect tears down (in-app route changes already get that from `onCleanup`
 * below).
 *
 * `visibilitychange` to `"hidden"` is the reliable signal across desktop and
 * mobile browsers (a background tab, an app switch, a real close all fire
 * it); `pagehide` covers the same-tab navigation/close cases some browsers
 * fire without a visibility change first. Neither can guarantee the write
 * completes before the page actually goes away — that is what "where the
