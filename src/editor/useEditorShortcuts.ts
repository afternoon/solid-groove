 * handlers the shortcut controller aggregates, which is a real architecture
 * change (today nothing but `EditorView` calls `useShortcuts`, and every

 * that is lifted to this level for exactly that reason). Building that
 * speculatively, with only one consumer, risks the "growing inline ladder"
 * this refactor exists to avoid in a different way. This module is still the

  // The surfaces this slice actually shows. The guide filters against these,

  // `piano_roll` (where `edit.delete` lives) and `selection` (where
  // `edit.duplicate`/`edit.select_all` live). `arrangement` is added while the
  // arrangement holds a live placement selection, the same conditional pattern
  // `selection` already follows for the piano roll, so
  // cut/copy/paste/delete/duplicate never steal a keystroke from an editor
  // that has nothing selected.
  //
  // A point, an empty range or a held clipboard keeps it active too (#292):
  // each covers no clip, but paste still has somewhere to go. Cut clears the
  // clips it took, and a click in empty space sets a point, so gating on
  // covered clips alone left Mod+V dead after either. Every other arrangement
  // edit keeps its own `isEnabled` on covered clips, so none of them fires.
  //
  // So does the arrangement having focus (#835), where Select all has to work
  // with nothing selected at all.
