/**
 * Splits a stem export into ZIPs that each fit the archive budget (EXP-004).
 *
 * An export over the budget is not refused: its stems are packed, in order,
 * into as many ZIPs as it takes, rendered and downloaded one after another.
 * The order is the reference mix (which mixes the whole selection, so it
 * lives in ZIP 1), then the selected tracks in track order, then the returns.
 * A stem keeps the name and number `planStems` gave it, so files from several
 * ZIPs sort together. A selection within budget is exactly one batch.
 *
 * A single stem heavier than the budget cannot be split: it gets a batch of
 * its own with `fits: false`, and `exportStems` refuses that ZIP with
 * `quota_exceeded`, as it refuses any archive over budget.
