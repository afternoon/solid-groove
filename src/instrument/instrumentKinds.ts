/**
 * The instrument kinds the app offers, and what moving a track between them
 * costs (#224, #223).
 *
 * Two surfaces choose an instrument kind — creating a track (`trackCreation`)
 * and changing an existing track's (`InstrumentKindPicker`) — and they were
 * written in parallel, each with its own copy of these facts. That divergence
 * was visible: a track *created* as a drum machine opened with different pads
 * from one *switched* to a drum machine. So the kind, its label, the
 * `instrument_type` it reports, and the instrument it mints are declared once,
 * here, and both surfaces read them.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates a project. `createInstrumentOfKind` builds the
 * instrument an `instrument.change` (or `track.add`) payload carries, so the
 * command layer stays the one mutation path (PRD section 9.6).
