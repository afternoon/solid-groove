 * The Tone-backed {@link PreviewEngine} the browser uses in production.

 * It plays a preview through the runtime's **shared destination** — the same
 * output the project plays through — so audition is heard exactly like the
 * project and is provably not part of any export/offline render (LIB-01:
 * "Audition ... does not become part of export"). Every node it builds is
 * registered with its own runtime project scope (`library-audition`), so
 * disposing the engine tears down its scope idempotently without touching the
 * project graph or the shared context (PRD AUD-07/AUD-09).
 *
 * The only place in the browser that touches Tone: like `toneBufferLoader.ts`,
 * it keeps the audition *policy* (`AuditionController`) Web-Audio-free and
 * testable, and confines the Web Audio calls to this one file.
