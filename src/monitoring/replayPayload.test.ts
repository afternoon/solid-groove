// ADR 0002 decision 3: "The `OPS-03` content rule extends to the replay
// payload. 'No project content, assistant text, user-entered strings, asset
// URLs, or tokens' already governs events and breadcrumbs. It now governs
// replays, and is enforced the same way — positively, by test, against the
// serialized payload rather than by inspection of the configuration."
//
// `scrub.test.ts` does that for events by planting every forbidden value into a
// hostile payload and asserting none of them survive *serialization*. This file
// is the same move for replay, and the reason it is a separate file is that the
// payload is a different thing: a replay is a serialized **DOM**, not a JSON
// event, and it is masked at capture rather than filtered on send.
//
// ## Why this is a real test and not a restatement of the configuration
//
// Asserting `maskAllText: true` — which `sentrySink.test.ts` does — proves the
// SDK was *told* to mask. It does not prove that a page built out of Solid
// Groove's own surfaces yields a payload with no project content in it, and
// those are different claims: text is not the only place content lives. A track
// name reaches the DOM through an `aria-label`, a `title`, a `value`, a
// `placeholder`, an `alt`, a `data-*` attribute, and an asset URL reaches it
// through `src` and `href` — none of which are text nodes, and several of which
// masking does not touch. So this builds a hostile document out of exactly those
// shapes and asserts against the serialized result.
//
// ## The model must never be stronger than the recorder
//
// Sentry's recorder is not run here — it is not importable outside
// `sentrySink.ts` (ADR 0001 decision 1), and running rrweb in jsdom would test
// rrweb rather than our surfaces. So masking is modelled, and the *direction* of
// that model is the property this whole file depends on.
//
// A model that masks **more** than the SDK does not fail safe. It certifies as
// clean a payload shape the real recorder would transmit in full, which is worse
// than having no test, because the acceptance box gets ticked on it. Every rule
// in `serializeUnderMasking` is therefore pinned to what `@sentry/replay`
// actually does:
//
// - `maskAttributes` defaults to exactly `["title", "placeholder", "aria-label"]`
//   and nothing else. `aria-description`, `aria-valuetext`, `alt`, `label` and
//   `download` are *not* masked — they reach the payload as written.
// - `transformAttribute` returns `src` and `href` early through `absoluteToDoc`
//   **before** the masking function is ever consulted, so a URL attribute is
//   resolved to absolute and emitted verbatim, query string included. `srcset`,
//   `poster` and `object[data]` take the same early exit.
// - `maskAllInputs` masks an input's `value`.
//
// What genuinely keeps asset URLs out is `blockAllMedia`, which blocks the SDK's
// `MEDIA_SELECTORS` outright, plus our own `BLOCK_CONTENT` subtrees. Those are
// modelled as blocked because they really are.
//
// So an `<a href>` or an unblocked `src` carrying a token *does* leak, and this
// file says so in a test rather than masking it away. The guards for that and
// for `data-*` scan the real source: the value is only knowable at runtime, so
// the question is what a surface may bind there at all.
