 * The assistant's project context (PRD section 9.8).

 * "Project analysis produces a compact, serializable context rather than
 * sending the full persistence document by default." This is that compact
 * context: track/section summaries and counts, never a full note-by-note
 * dump of the project, a Firestore document, or provider-specific objects.
 * The one place notes appear is `selectedNotes`: the raw events of the
 * current selection and nothing outside it (ADR 0007, `selectedNotes.ts`),
 * which is what lets the assistant edit the notes a producer is working on.
 * The current
 * selection is folded in as a short human-readable description (never as the
 * `SelectionScope` values verbatim), because a conversation turn or a
 * selection change is, per the same PRD section, something the assistant
 * reads about the user's intent, not a project mutation of its own.
