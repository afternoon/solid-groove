/**
 * How a user's storage total moves when an object is written or deleted (#282).
 *
 * The Cloud Function in `functions/src/index.ts` is a thin wrapper that hands
 * Cloud Storage's `finalized` and `deleted` events to {@link recordObjectWritten}
 * and {@link recordObjectDeleted} inside a Firestore transaction. The rules are
 * all here, over a {@link UsageTransaction} interface, so they are unit-tested
 * without a function runtime or a database:
 *
 *  - an event is **idempotent**. Cloud Storage delivers at least once, so each
 *    object has a ledger entry recording the generation it is about and what
 *    happened to it, and a repeat changes nothing;
 *  - events arrive in **any order**. An event for a generation older than the
 *    one the entry is about is stale. A delete that arrives before its write
 *    leaves a tombstone for that generation, so the late write is not counted
 *    for an object that no longer exists. An overwrite is a delete of the old
 *    generation and a write of the new one, and balances either way round;
 *  - the **allowance holds** even when uploads race. `storage.rules` check the
 *    total before a write, but the total only moves once the function runs, so
 *    two uploads started together can each pass. A write that would take the
 *    account over {@link USER_DATA_CAP_BYTES} is refused here instead: it is
 *    not counted, and the outcome tells the function to delete the object.
 *    That delete's own event then finds a `refused` entry and changes nothing;
 *  - only `users/{uid}/{kind}/…` objects of a declared kind count. The factory
 *    library and anything else in the bucket are skipped.
