/**
 * Proves {@link seedRegisteredSession} — the harness plumbing that gets a flow
 * whose precondition is "signed in to an account" to its starting line without
 * driving the login control (see that module for why).
 *
 * It needs proving *here* rather than only in the flows that use it: every
 * flow that starts signed in rests on it (#854 retired guest start), so a
 * failure here explains a wall of red flows in one line. These are the tests
 * that fail if the SDK changes how it persists a user. Against the emulator rather than the mock
 * backend for the obvious reason — a session that restores from storage is
 * exactly what the mock backend has none of.
