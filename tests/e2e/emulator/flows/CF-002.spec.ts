/**
 * `CF-002` — a producer builds a five-part loop.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words.
 *
 * **Trimmed for #817.** This flow used to go on to turn the loop into a song
 * outline (#61, ARR-003). That requirement was dropped when #61 closed, and no
 * outline was built, so steps 7-11 could never pass. The flow now ends where
 * its working part ends, at the playing loop, plus the reload every flow ends
 * on. Steps 1-6 and their assertions are unchanged.
 *
 * **Revised for #496.** Hats and Claps are drum-machine tracks sequenced on the
 * step grid by pad ("HH, step 3, on"); Chords and Bass are sampler tracks
 * written in the piano roll at C4, which plays the sample as recorded.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** A clip opens on the sequence view (`/sequence`) and `1`
 * leaves it; a sampler's sound comes from its sample slot through the Library
 * view, and Enter inserts and comes back.
