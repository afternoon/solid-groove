/**
 * `CF-004` — a producer sets the span they are working in.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for `LOOP-018` (#280)
 * and is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to
 * say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * `test.fixme` because none of the loop-brace surface exists yet — #280 is the
 * PR that removes this marker. What is missing today:
 *
 *  - **The brace itself.** `src/arrangement/canvasRenderer.ts` draws the ruler,
 *    sections and playhead; nothing draws a loop brace, and nothing lets a
 *    pointer grab one. #280's own acceptance criteria put it in the same paint
 *    pass rather than in an overlay element.
 *  - **Its persistence.** `songSchema` (`src/domain/entities.ts`) has no loop
 *    range or loop toggle, so step 7's reload has nothing to reopen with. That
 *    is #278, which lands before #280.
 *  - **Looping on by default.** `useProjectAudio` starts with
 *    `loopEnabled = false` today, so step 1's "looping is on" is new too.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator rather than the mock backend,
 * because step 7 is a real `page.reload()` and the mock repository is a fresh,
 * empty store on every page load.
 *
 * Two requirements this spec places on #280, both because the ruler is a canvas
 * and canvas pixels can never be the only representation of state (PRD 9.3, and
 * the same rule `ArrangementView`'s existing hidden mirrors already follow):
 *
 *  1. **An accessible mirror of the brace**, at
 *     `data-testid="arrangement-loop-live"`, phrased like the selection mirror
 *     beside it and naming the *inclusive* first and last bar: a brace over the
 *     first bar alone reads "bars 1 to 1", and one over bars 1 and 2 reads
 *     "bars 1 to 2". #280 already owes assistive technology an announcement of
 *     the brace; this is that announcement, read by a test.
 *  2. **The timeline's horizontal scale**, as `data-pixels-per-tick` on the
 *     arrangement root. Step 3 is a pointer drag on a canvas, so it can only be
 *     performed by coordinate, and a spec that hardcoded the zoom constant
 *     would break the first time anyone changed it.
