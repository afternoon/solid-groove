/**
 * `CF-005` — a producer brings a library loop into their project.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for `LOOP-019` (#281)
 * and is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to
 * say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **Rewritten by #304**, which makes the library a modal opened from a slot
 * rather than a panel standing open beside the arrangement. This spec used to
 * drag a row out of that panel and drop it on the track area; there is nothing
 * to drag out of a window that covers the thing you would drop onto, so the
 * producer now asks the arrangement for a loop and picks one. The outcome the
 * flow asserts is the same in every particular: a new track at the bottom,
 * carrying that loop as a clip at bar 1, and nothing else in the project moved.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** The library is the Library view on `4`, not a modal,
 * and the sequence editor the view on `2`. The arrangement's library button aims
 * the Library view at a new track, Enter inserts and goes back to the
 * arrangement, and `1` leaves the sequence view. Parked at `test.fixme` until
 * #817's stack lands: the PR that closes #817 removes the marker.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator rather than the mock backend,
 * because step 7 is a real `page.reload()` and the mock repository is a fresh,
 * empty store on every page load.
 *
 * Like CF-004, this spec needs the timeline's horizontal scale to work in a
 * canvas: it reads `data-pixels-per-tick` off the arrangement root, because the
 * only way to observe *where* a canvas-drawn clip landed is to click it and see
 * what gets selected.

 * it *does* dictate is that the arrangement has such a control at all: with the
 * library panel gone, a producer with an empty song and no sampler track to
 * fill has no other way to reach a sound.
