/**
 * `CF-006` — a producer brings their own sounds into a pack.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for `LIB-09` (#282) and
 * is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to say
 * so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **Made to pass by #282**, which built personal packs: **My packs** in the
 * library's rail, "Add pack", importing by drop into Cloud Storage under the
 * owning user, and the Storage emulator in this suite.
 *
 * The library is the Library view (#817), a region named "Library" at
 * `/projects/:id/library`, read through `../support/library` as the other
 * library flows read it; My packs is in its rail. A new project's starter
 * track aims it at its drum machine's first pad, so `4` reaches it.
 *
 * {@link soundFrom} matches a sound's whole name rather than any name
 * containing the file's: the factory library has a "Dusty Tape Kick", and a
 * search for "tape" lists both it and the producer's "tape kick".
 *
 * Runs against the emulator rather than the mock backend for two reasons at
 * once: the account in its precondition is a real one, and step 7 is a real
 * `page.reload()`.
 *
 * Two things about how this flow is driven, neither of which is an assertion
 * about our product:
 *
 *  - **The signed-in account is installed, not logged into.** `seedRegisteredSession`
 *    puts a persisted session in the browser the way a returning visitor already
 *    has one, so this flow never touches the login control — see that module for
 *    why a flow about importing sounds should not answer for the login UI. What
 *    the flow does assert is that it *starts* signed in to an account rather than
 *    as a guest, which is step 1.
 *  - **The files are synthesised and dropped through a `DataTransfer`.** No
 *    browser automation can drag a file off a real desktop, so
 *    {@link dropAudioFiles} builds real, decodable WAV files in the page and
 *    dispatches the drag sequence with them. That is the same `drop` event the
 *    operating system would deliver.
