/**
 * `CF-007` — a producer drives the whole mix through an overdrive.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for `LOOP-020` (#283)
 * and is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to
 * say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **Rewritten by #304**, which replaces the editor's main region with three
 * views. The master chain is reached by going to the **mixer** and selecting
 * the master strip, not by switching a tab inside the arrangement; and step 1
 * brings its loop in through the library, as CF-005 does. Everything
 * this flow proves — the chain, the commands behind it, the control, the
 * reload — is unchanged.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** Step 1 brings its loop in through the Library view on
 * `4`, as CF-005 now does: the arrangement's library button aims it at a new
 * track and Enter inserts and goes back to the arrangement. The mixer is
 * the view on `5`. Parked at `test.fixme` until #817's stack lands: the PR that
 * closes #817 removes the marker.
 *
 * **Revised for #937.** A new project's master starts with a visible Limiter
 * in place of the hidden safety limiter (a product-owner decision), so step 4
 * finds the Limiter alone on the chain rather than an empty one, and every
 * count below is one higher. The overdrive is added before it (a new master
 * device never goes after a Limiter at the end) and is still what
 * the flow undoes, redoes, drives and reloads; its Drive is found on its own
 * card, since the Limiter has a Drive too.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator rather than the mock backend,
 * because step 8 is a real `page.reload()` and the mock repository is a fresh,
 * empty store on every page load.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why the undo comes before the drive is pushed.** A parameter gesture is a
 * command and therefore its own history entry (PRD 9.6; #283's criterion that a
 * control gesture "commits as one history entry per gesture"). Undoing after it
 * would put the drive back rather than take the device off, and redoing an
 * `device.add` restores the device as its payload described it, not as a later
 * edit left it. The flow undoes and redoes the add first, then pushes the drive,
 * so each of its claims is literally true. The register was corrected to match
 * before this spec was written; see CF-007's "Out of scope".
