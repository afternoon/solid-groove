/**
 * `CF-008` — a producer moves between the five views by dock and by keyboard.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. It was the acceptance contract for `UI-001` (#304), and
 * is **rewritten for #817**, which puts five views on `1`–`5`: Arrangement,
 * Sequence, Instrument, Library, Mixer. It is frozen once it lands: a later PR
 * that changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * `test.fixme` until #817's stack lands; the PR that closes #817 removes this
 * marker. What is missing today:
 *
 *  - **Sequence is a modal**, a dialog over the arrangement opened from a clip,
 *    with no key and no address. #817 makes it the view on `2`, with an empty
 *    screen when no clip is selected.
 *  - **The dock has three labelled links** and the instrument and mixer sit on
 *    `2` and `3`. #817 draws five icon tiles with their keys, moves the
 *    instrument to `3` and the mixer to `5`, and gives each tile a hover tip.
 *  - **The mixer does not say where you came from.** #817's `5` lands with the
 *    track you came from marked.
 *
 * Every locator #817 introduces is assumed, and listed in `../support/views.ts`.
 * The tiles carry no visible label, so the view you are on is read by
 * accessible name, never by text.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator, like every core flow: step 9 is a
 * real `page.reload()`, and the mock backend is a fresh, empty store on every
 * page load.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this flow moves by keyboard *and* by dock.** Two entrypoints that reach
 * different states is the classic way a switcher rots. Steps 2 and 4-7 use
 * keys, step 8 the dock and the back button, and every one of them asserts the
 * dock's current-view marker through `expectView`, so the paths are held to the
 * same state by construction.
