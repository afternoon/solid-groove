/**
 * `CF-009`: a producer clicks a clip and is told which one it is.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is one of the three acceptance contracts for #292
 * (one arrangement selection), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that
 * changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because the arrangement still has two selections. Clicking
 * a placement today sets `placementEditingController`'s ID set and says nothing
 * to the `aria-live` mirror, which only ever reads the shell's one-bar range.
 * None of the three announcements below exists yet. The PR that closes #292
 * removes this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #292 to, from the product owner's decisions on the issue:
 *
 *  - **A clip is announced with its whole bars.** Clips snap to bars, so one
 *    clip reads "Selected clip on {track}, bar N" (or "bars N to M").
 *  - **A click in empty space sets a point**: a zero-length cursor, announced
 *    as "Position {bar}.{beat}.{sixteenth}".
 *  - **A range on one track that covers no clip is named by exact position**,
 *    also in bars.beats.sixteenths: "Selected {track}, 3.1.2 to 3.4.4".
 *  - **One selection, not two.** A point or a range in empty space replaces the
 *    clip selection instead of sitting beside it.
 *
 * Points and ranges do not snap, and the pointer can only land on a whole
 * pixel. At the zoom a new project opens with, a pixel is about 7 ticks and a
 * sixteenth is 48. So every point and range end here is aimed a quarter of
 * the way into a sixteenth (12 ticks in). A pixel either way cannot leave that
 * sixteenth. Because the aim is short of halfway, naming the sixteenth a
 * position falls in and naming the nearest one give the same answer.
 *
 * The outlines themselves (dotted for the range, solid on a selected clip) are
 * canvas pixels, so this spec can only show them in the walkthrough.
 * `canvasRenderer.test.ts` is where #292 asserts the two strokes differ.
