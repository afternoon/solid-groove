/**
 * `CF-010`: a producer drags across tracks to select clips and deletes them.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is one of the three acceptance contracts for #292
 * (one arrangement selection), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that
 * changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because none of this exists yet. Today a press on empty
 * space selects one bar on one track, a drag does not extend it, a bar range
 * never selects the placements under it, and Delete acts only on
 * `placementEditingController`'s own ID set. The PR that closes #292 removes
 * this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #292 to, from the product owner's decisions on the issue (the
 * whole-clip model revised on 2026-09-25):
 *
 *  - **A drag can cross more than one track**, and on release it selects every
 *    clip it wholly contains or overlaps, as whole clips. The band itself does
 *    not persist.
 *  - **Several selected clips are announced as a count**: "{n} clips selected".
 *  - **Delete removes the selected clips, whole.** Nothing is trimmed: the
 *    Sampler clip the drag only overlapped goes entirely, not just the part the
 *    drag covered. Nothing unselected is touched, and the result survives a
 *    reload.
 *  - **A drag that touches no clip selects nothing**: "No selection". The spec
 *    repeats step 2's drag after the delete to show that stretch is empty.
 *  - **A click in empty space sets a point at the start of the bar clicked
 *    in**: "Position {bar}.1.1". The spec clicks where the Sampler clip began to
 *    show that no trimmed remainder of it is left there.
 *
 * The drag starts in empty space because pressing on a clip and dragging moves
 * the clip. Neither end of it is announced any more, so its ends only have to
 * sit clear of clip edges. They are aimed a quarter of the way into the 2.3.1
 * and 4.3.1 sixteenths, as the flow words them, half a bar from the nearest
 * bar line, where the pointer landing on a whole pixel (about 7 ticks at the
 * opening zoom) cannot change which clips the drag touches.
 *
 * Step 1 moves one clip by its body and lengthens another by the resize handle
 * on its right edge. Both are ARR-002 gestures that #292 keeps, and both still
 * snap to whole bars, so the clips step 1 makes are named by whole bars.
 *
 * Whether a clip is still there is read the way a screen-reader user would
 * find out: select it and listen.
