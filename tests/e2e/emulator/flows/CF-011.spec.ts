/**
 * `CF-011`: a producer zooms in on what they selected.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is one of the three acceptance contracts for #292
 * (one arrangement selection), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that
 * changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because `view.zoom_to_selection` reads only the shell's
 * one-track bar range today. A clicked placement leaves that range empty, so
 * zooming does nothing (the gap #292 names), and a drag cannot yet select
 * clips across tracks. The PR that closes #292 removes this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #292 to, from the product owner's decisions on the issue (the
 * whole-clip model revised on 2026-09-25): zoom to selection frames the
 * selected clips' extent, from the first one's start to the last one's end,
 * and a single clicked clip, from the toolbar button and from the `Z`
 * shortcut. A drag selects whole clips and its band does not persist, so there
 * is no dragged stretch left to frame. "Frames" is read off the arrangement
 * itself: the span of ticks the timeline shows is its scroll offset and its
 * width, both divided by the published horizontal scale.
 *
 * The drag in step 2 runs from halfway through bar 2 to halfway through bar 4,
 * so it starts halfway into a clip it only overlaps and ends half a bar past
 * the last clip it contains. Step 3 expects bars 2 to 3 exactly, the selected
 * clips and nothing else, so framing the dragged stretch instead of the clips
 * fails step 3 by half a bar at both edges. It starts in empty space because
 * pressing on a clip and dragging moves the clip.
 *
 * The drag is announced as "2 clips selected", with no position in it, and
 * the framed edges are the clips' bar lines, not where the pointer landed. So
 * its ends only have to sit clear of clip edges, which the middle of a bar
 * does. `EDGE_TOLERANCE_TICKS` allows for sub-pixel scroll rounding.
