/**
 * `CF-012` — a producer builds an effects chain on one track.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`; the numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for `LOOP-017` (#241)
 * and is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to
 * say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * `test.fixme` because the surface is missing — #241 is the PR that removes
 * this marker. Everything under it exists: the six device types and their
 * parameter definitions (`src/domain/devices.ts`), the `device.*` commands
 * (`src/commands/definitions/devices.ts`), and `DeviceChain` on every track
 * (`src/audio/DeviceChain.ts`). What does not is the panel: the instrument view
 * has only the empty "Device chain" slot UI-001 reserved for it
 * (`src/editor/DeviceChainSlot.tsx`).
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator rather than the mock backend,
 * because step 9 is a real `page.reload()` and the mock repository is a fresh,
 * empty store on every page load.
