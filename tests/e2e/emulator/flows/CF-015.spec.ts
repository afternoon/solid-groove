/**
 * `CF-015`: a producer picks out several clips with the keyboard held down.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for #405, and it is
 * frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to say
 * so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because none of this exists yet. Today a click on a clip
 * replaces the selection whatever modifier is held, so the arrangement can only
 * hold several clips at once through a drag in empty space (CF-010). The PR
 * that closes #405 removes this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #405 to, from the product owner's decisions (2026-09-27):
 *
 *  - **Cmd-click (Ctrl-click off macOS) toggles one clip** in or out of the
 *    selection and keeps the rest. Playwright's `ControlOrMeta` presses the
 *    right one for the platform the browser runs on.
 *  - **Shift-click extends the selection to a box**: every clip on every track
 *    between the selection and the clicked clip, over the time from the
 *    earliest start to the latest end among them. From the "BD" clip in bar 3
 *    to the "Sampler" clip in bar 2 that is bars 2 to 3 on both tracks, so the
 *    clips in bar 1 stay out. No anchor is remembered beyond the selection
 *    itself, which is why step 4 leaves only bar 3 selected first.
 *  - **The result is one ordinary selection**, announced as a count like a
 *    drag's, and Delete removes exactly those clips, whole.
 *
 * Whether a clip is still there is read the way a screen-reader user would
 * find out: select it and listen (as in CF-010).
