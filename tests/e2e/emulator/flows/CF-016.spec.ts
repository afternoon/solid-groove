/**
 * `CF-016`: a producer Alt-drags clips to copy them.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for #456, and it is
 * frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to say
 * so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because none of this exists yet. Today a drag on a clip's
 * body moves only the clip pressed on, whatever modifier is held. The PR that
 * closes #456 removes this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #456 to, from the product owner's decisions (2026-09-27):
 *
 *  - **Alt (Option on macOS) turns a body drag into a copy**, as in Ableton
 *    Live. Playwright's `Alt` is the Option key on macOS.
 *  - **It copies the whole selection**, each clip on its own track, keeping
 *    their spacing. Step 4 pins this: the Sampler copy in bar 5 only exists
 *    if the bar-3 Sampler clip was selected alongside the one pressed on.
 *  - **The copies are independent**: a fresh clip each, so an edit to one is
 *    not heard in the other (CLP-01's "independent" mode, not "linked").
 *  - **The copies become the selection**, which is what lets step 4 chain.
 *
 * The two clips are selected with a drag in empty space (CF-010), not with
 * Shift- or Cmd-click, so this flow does not wait on #405.
 *
 * Whether a clip is still there is read the way a screen-reader user would
 * find out: select it and listen (as in CF-010 and CF-015).
