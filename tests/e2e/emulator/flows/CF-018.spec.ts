/**
 * `CF-018`: a producer picks a key and pulls stray notes into it.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is one of the three acceptance contracts for #450
 * (ARR-010, the piano roll redesign), and it is frozen once it lands: a later
 * PR that changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because none of this exists yet. Today's key guide is a
 * view-only toggle that is never saved, offers only major and minor, and has
 * no Quantize to scale. The PR that closes #450 removes this marker.
 *
 * The roll's pitch rows, ruler and notes are found exactly as in CF-017 (read
 * its header for that contract). On top of it, this flow needs:
 *
 *  - **The Key panel**, a region named "Key", whose status reads the key:
 *    "Chromatic", or "<root> <scale>" such as "C minor".
 *  - **Root buttons**: a group named "Root" in that panel holding the twelve
 *    roots, "C" to "B", with the chosen one `aria-pressed="true"`.
 *  - **The scale switch**: a group named "Scale" in that panel holding one
 *    button per scale, named as the issue lists them ("Chromatic", "Minor", …).
 *  - **An Off row** is a pitch row whose name ends in "Off", e.g. "F♯2 Off".
 *  - **The Transform panel**, a region named "Transform", holding the button
 *    "Quantize to scale".
 *
 * Which scale note Quantize to scale picks is the implementer's rule and out of
 * scope, so the spec asserts only that the stray note lands on a C minor row
 * at the step it started on, and is the only note that moved.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 6 is a real reload.
