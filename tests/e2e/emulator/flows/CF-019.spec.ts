/**
 * `CF-019`: a producer copies, pastes and transforms notes from the keyboard.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is one of the three acceptance contracts for #450
 * (ARR-010, the piano roll redesign), and it is frozen once it lands: a later
 * PR that changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * #647 changed step 6: Double used to refuse copies that would not fit in the
 * clip, and now makes room for them by doubling the clip.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** The sequence editor is a view on `2`, not a dialog over
 * the arrangement: opening the clip lands on it (`/sequence`), and step 7
 * leaves it with `1` rather than Esc, which closes dialogs (#650). Parked at
 * `test.fixme` (on the describe, so the body keeps its indentation) until
 * #817's stack lands; the PR that closes #817 removes the marker.
 *
 * The roll's pitch rows, ruler, notes and selection count are found exactly as
 * in CF-017 (read its header for that contract). On top of it, this flow needs:
 *
 *  - **The ruler's step buttons set the insert marker** when clicked
 *    ("Step 9"), which is where a paste lands.
 *  - **The Transform panel**, a region named "Transform", whose scope label
 *    reads "All <n> notes" or "<n> selected notes", with a field labelled
 *    "Semitones" whose value reads "+12 st", and the buttons "Transpose" and
 *    "Double". The ruler has one step button per 1/16 of the clip, so its
 *    last button says how long the clip is.
 *
 * Every key goes through the shortcut registry, so the spec presses them on
 * the page, never on a particular element. `ControlOrMeta` is ⌘ on macOS and
 * Ctrl elsewhere, as the flow says.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 7 is a real reload.
