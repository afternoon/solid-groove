/**
 * `CF-020`: a producer fills a drum row from the Generate panel.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. It is the acceptance contract for #643 (the step
 * sequencer revamp), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes
 * an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because the revamp does not exist yet. Today's step grid
 * has no selectable row and no Generate panel. The PR that closes #643
 * removes this marker.
 *
 * What the step grid has to expose for a person, and this spec, to follow
 * the journey:
 *
 *  - **Rows** are buttons in a group named "Rows", one per pad, named by the
 *    pad ("BD", "Pad 2"). The selected row's button is `aria-pressed="true"`.
 *  - **Steps** are buttons named "<pad>, step <n>, on|off", as today
 *    (CF-001), so the spec reads a row by which of its steps are on.
 *  - **The Generate panel** is a region named "Generate". It shows
 *    "into <pad>" for the selected row. Its presets are buttons named by the
 *    pattern ("Offbeats"). The Euclidean generator has spinbuttons named
 *    "Hits" and "Steps" and a button named "Write Euclidean".
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 8 is a real reload.
