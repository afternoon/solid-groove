/**
 * `CF-024`: a producer browses packs and uses a sound from one they did not
 * have.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments are its steps,
 * in its words. This is the acceptance contract for #449 (LIB-010, the library
 * redesign), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an
 * assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** The library is the Library view on `4`, filling the
 * page, not a dialog over the editor. Insert keeps it open, showing the
 * inserted impact as the sound in the slot, `3` goes back to the instrument,
 * and `4` comes back to the library still aimed at the "BD" pad. Live since
 * #817's closing PR removed its `test.fixme`.
 *
 * **Locators.** Every library locator is assumed from #449 and the reference
 * design, and listed in `../support/library.ts`. This spec adds its own for
 * the packs view:
 *
 *  - each pack cover is a button whose name starts "Open <pack name>", and a
 *    cover for a pack the project uses carries the words "In project" (or
 *    "In this project") in its text;
 *  - the "Packs with" filter is a group named "Packs with" holding a toggle
 *    button per family, named for it ("FX");
 *  - the pack banner is headed by the pack's name and says "Joins the project
 *    when you insert a sound" (or "In this project").
 *
 * **Fixture library.** The emulator suite serves the delivered library
 * `bun run library:build` writes, read back by `deliveredLibrary()`. The flow
 * names the pack, so the spec finds "Transitions & FX" by that name there, and
 * derives everything else from the served library rather than naming sounds:
 * the project's own pack (the starter kick's), the packs with FX, and the
 * pack's impacts. A new project uses only the starter kick's pack, so
 * Transitions & FX is one it does not use.
 *
 * Out of scope, per the flow: "Hear it", pack search, category-row scrolling,
 * removing a pack, and third-party or personal packs.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 8 is a real reload.
