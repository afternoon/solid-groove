/**
 * `CF-026`: a producer keeps a sound as a favourite and finds it in another
 * project.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments are its steps,
 * in its words. This is the acceptance contract for the favourites slice of
 * #449 (LIB-010, the library redesign), and it is frozen once it lands: a
 * later PR that changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and
 * justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because favourites need somewhere to live: per-user
 * favourites in Firestore are #691 (LIB-011), a persistence contract change.
 * Until #691 is in, this flow cannot be walked.
 *
 * **Revised for #817.** The library is the Library view on `4`, not a dialog
 * with a close button: leaving it without inserting is pressing `3`, Insert
 * keeps it open, and step 6 comes back to it with `4`. The marker stays until
 * both #691 and #817's stack land; the PR that lands the later of the two
 * removes it.
 *
 * **Locators.** Every library locator is assumed from #449 and the reference
 * design, and listed in `../support/library.ts`. This spec relies on two in
 * particular:
 *
 *  - the heart is a toggle button named "Favourite <name>", pressed when the
 *    sound is a favourite ("its heart fills");
 *  - the rail's "Favourites" button shows how many there are, so "Favourites
 *    counts one" is its text reading "Favourites" then 1.
 *
 * The way back to the dashboard is the editor header's "Projects" link, which
 * exists today (`src/editor/EditorHeader.tsx`).
 *
 * **Fixture library.** Any kick will do, so the delivered library the emulator
 * suite serves already meets this flow's preconditions.
 *
 * Out of scope, per the flow: favourites on another device or browser, a
 * guest's favourites after registering (both #691's, in the rules and
 * repository suites), and unfavouriting.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 6 is a real reload.
