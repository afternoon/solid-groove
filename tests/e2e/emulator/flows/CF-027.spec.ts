/**
 * `CF-027`: a producer asks the assistant for a change, tries it, and keeps it.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments are its steps,
 * in its words. This is the acceptance contract for #72 (AI-004, the assistant
 * conversation and proposal UI), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR
 * that changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because the assistant does not exist yet. The PR that
 * closes #72 removes this marker.
 *
 * **Locators.** Every assistant locator is assumed from #72 and its reference
 * design, and listed in `../support/assistant.ts`.
 *
 * **The scripted provider.** The flow's precondition is that the emulator
 * suite's gateway answers from a scripted provider (#69), not a model: asked
 * to loosen the beat, it proposes swing at 58% and the BD track 3 dB quieter.
 * The spec cannot arrange that itself, and does not try. The two values are
 * read from the proposal's own rows where they matter, so the spec pins the
 * shape of the proposal, not the fader's scale.
 *
 * **The disclosure.** #95 will ask for the assistant disclosure before the
 * first message. It lands after #72, so that PR seeds the account as having
 * seen it; this spec does not click through it.
 *
 * Out of scope, per the flow: what the assistant says, stopping a reply,
 * provider failure, stale proposals, "Why this works", the preview and changed
 * outlines, audibility, and pack and video recommendations.
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 9 is a real reload.
