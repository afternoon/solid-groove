/**
 * `CF-029`: a producer selects every clip in the arrangement with Cmd+A.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments below are its
 * steps, in its words. This is the acceptance contract for #835, and it is
 * frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion here has to say
 * so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * It is `test.fixme` because none of this exists yet. Today `edit.select_all`
 * is registered for the `selection` (piano roll) context only, so in the
 * arrangement Cmd+A falls through to the browser and selects the page's text;
 * and Escape does not clear the arrangement's selection. The PR that closes
 * #835 removes this marker.
 *
 * What it holds #835 to, from the product owner's decisions (2026-10-01):
 *
 *  - **Cmd+A (Ctrl+A off macOS) selects every clip in the song**, on every
 *    track, and prevents the browser's select-all-text default. Playwright's
 *    `ControlOrMeta` presses the right one for the platform.
 *  - **It works with nothing selected**: step 5 presses it straight after
 *    Escape has emptied the selection.
 *  - **Escape clears the selection** once there is no surface open and no drag
 *    in flight.
 *  - **The result is one ordinary selection**, announced as a count, and Delete
 *    removes exactly those clips, whole.
 *
 * "No text on the page is highlighted" is read from `window.getSelection()`,
 * which is what the report in #835 measured (244 characters).
