/**
 * `CF-033`: a producer finds a sound they heard earlier.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments are its steps,
 * in its words. This is the acceptance contract for the recently heard half of
 * #815, and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that changes an assertion
 * here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **Locators.** The library's locators are `../support/library.ts`'s. This
 * spec relies on three of its own, which #815 builds to:
 *
 *  - the rail's place is a button named "Recently heard";
 *  - its empty state is text starting "Nothing heard yet", and says how to
 *    hear something by naming auditioning;
 *  - the place lists its sounds in the same "Sounds" list as All sounds, so
 *    the order on screen is `listedNames(soundList(page))`.
 *
 * **Fixture library.** Any three kicks will do: the BD pad opens the library
 * on kicks, and the delivered library the emulator suite serves holds more
 * than four, so the preconditions are met.
 *
 * Out of scope, per the flow: how many sounds the list keeps (unit-tested),
 * another device or browser, and Browse packs' "Hear it" (component-tested).
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because step 5 is a real reload,
 * and recently heard has to survive it.
