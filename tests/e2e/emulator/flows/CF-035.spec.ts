/**
 * `CF-035`: a new producer meets Cue and opens the studio.
 *
 * Read the flow in `docs/core-flows.md`. The numbered comments are its steps,
 * in its words. This is the acceptance contract for GRV-25 (onboarding with
 * Cue and producer memory), and it is frozen once it lands: a later PR that
 * changes an assertion here has to say so in its body and justify it.
 *
 * **The account.** Every other spec's fresh account has skipped onboarding
 * (`seedRegisteredSession`); this one asks for an account with no profile,
 * which is what a producer who has never been through it has. It imports
 * Playwright's `test` and seeds its own account for that reason.
 *
 * **Locators** are `../support/onboarding.ts`'s, written from the spec against
 * roles and accessible names only.
 *
 * Out of scope, per the flow: what Cue says after onboarding, skipping the
 * whole welcome, the Memory page, memory notes, the nudge, the consented
 * validation event, and the lesson itself (GRV-43).
 *
 * Runs against the Firestore/Auth emulator because steps 8 and 9 are a real
 * reload and a real profile read.
