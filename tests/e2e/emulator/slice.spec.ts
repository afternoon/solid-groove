    // device (wrong: the context constructs, so there is no missing-device

    // cannot be installed in the development sandbox, so each attempt costs a

    // unlock is now bounded by a timeout, so a never-settling `resume()`
    // rejects and Firefox emits `audio_start_failed` with the browser-blocked
    // flag rather than nothing at all (`AUD-07`). It does not make Firefox
    // play, so this guard stays: a bounded failure is still a failure. Why
