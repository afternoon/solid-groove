/**
 * Shared steps and locators for the assistant's core flows (CF-027, CF-028).
 *
 * Every locator below was written from #72 and its reference design,
 * `docs/assistant-panel.html`, before the assistant existed, against
 * accessible names and roles only, so the implementation is free to arrange
 * its markup. The panel (#849), the conversation (GRV-26) and the proposal
 * card (GRV-5) meet them as written.
 *
 *  - the header's "Assistant" button (`aria-keyshortcuts` carries Ctrl+K/⌘K);
 *  - the panel: a region named "Assistant", whose header has "Minimise",
 *    "Dock to the right", "Float" and "Close" buttons. Minimised, the region
 *    is the header bar alone, and a click on its title floats it again;
 *  - its resize edge: a separator named "Resize height" while floating and
 *    "Resize width" while docked;
 *  - the composer: a textbox named "Message the assistant", and a button named
 *    "Scope: <what>" that says what the assistant reads and may change;
 *  - the conversation: a log named "Conversation";
 *  - a proposal: a region named "Proposal" with "Preview", "Apply" and "Cancel"
 *    buttons, which says "Applied" once it has been.
 *
 * Existing editor names it reads: the header's "Swing" button, whose title is
 * "Swing <n>%" (#447), the mixer's "Volume for <track>" slider (CF-008), and
 * the view dock's links (CF-008).
