/**
 * What the redesigned library's core flows (CF-023 to CF-026 and CF-030, #449
 * and #817) share: the way from the dashboard to a drum pad's sample slot, the
 * locators for the Library view, and a read of the library the emulator suite
 * serves.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in each spec so the four contracts name the same
 * surface the same way. Each spec keeps its own numbered steps, assertions and
 * `step()` captions.
 *
 * **Every library locator below is assumed.** None of this UI exists yet. They
 * come from #449's decisions and the reference design (`docs/library-browser.html`,
 * on `claude/keen-hamilton-vdhzy4`), matched by role and purpose as CF-005 does.
 * The implementing PRs build to these names, or say in their body why one had
 * to change:
 *
 *  - the library is a **view** (#817), a region named "Library" that fills the
 *    page at `/projects/:id/library`. There is no dialog and no close button:
 *    `3` goes back to the instrument without inserting;
 *  - the header is a heading that names the target as a path, starting
 *    "Inserting into" ("Inserting into BD › Drum machine › BD");
 *  - its readouts are groups named "In the slot" (the sound the slot holds
 *    now, which follows each insert) and "Hearing" (the one selected);
 *  - the rail has buttons whose names start "Browse packs", "All sounds" and
 *    "Favourites", the one in view marked `aria-current`, and the project's
 *    packs in a group named "In this project";
 *  - family tabs are tabs named for the family ("Drums…"); category chips are
 *    toggle buttons named for the category ("Kick…", "Impact…");
 *  - the genre menu opens from a button named "Any genre" and holds a
 *    checkbox per genre, named for it ("House…");
 *  - the result count reads "<n> sounds";
 *  - sounds are a list named "Sounds" (or "Similar sounds"); each row has an
 *    "Audition <name>" button, a "Favourite <name>" toggle and a
 *    "Sounds like <name>" button;
 *  - the primary action is a button whose name starts "Insert <name>". It does
 *    what `Enter` does: it inserts and stays in the library;
 *  - a sample slot is still a button named "Sample for <pad>", showing the
 *    sound's name, the library's icon and the key `4`. The slot the library is
 *    aimed at is marked `aria-current="true"`.
 *
 * The rest is surface that exists today: the drum machine region and its
 * pads' "Audition <pad>" and "Sample for <pad>" buttons (#447), the slot's
 * `.sample-slot-name` (the one part of the slot that is only the sound's
 * name), and the header's "Undo" button. The views are `./views.ts`'s.
