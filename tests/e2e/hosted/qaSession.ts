 * Signs a page into the live app as one of the QA accounts (#1055), with no

 *
 * A dedicated service account, whose key is the `QA_SIGN_IN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
 * secret, signs a Firebase custom token for the slot's account with the Admin
 * SDK; this process exchanges it for a session with the same Firebase client
 * SDK the app runs (`signInWithCustomToken`); and that user's own `toJSON()`
 * is written into the page's IndexedDB by `installFirebaseUser`, the code the
 * emulator suite installs its sessions with. The app is not changed: nothing
 * in its bundle knows about QA accounts or custom tokens.
 *
 * Firebase does not run blocking functions for a custom-token sign-in, so the
 * allowlist gate never sees these. The accounts are allowlisted and verified
 * all the same (`bun run qa:accounts`), see `docs/runbooks/alpha-allowlist.md`.
 *
 * Every failure says what is wrong without the key, the token or the address:
 * the hosted suites' logs and reports are uploaded, and the sweep's become
 * public issues.
