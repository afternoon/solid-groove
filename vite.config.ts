// PRD `OPS-01`: every build stamps the git commit SHA into the client so the

// it to the exact commit it built and deployed); `GITHUB_SHA` is Actions'
// automatic fallback for any other workflow run (e.g. the always-on `build`
// job, which never sets `VITE_RELEASE_SHA` itself). A local `bun run build`
// or `bun run dev` has neither, so it falls back to the working tree's own
// HEAD, and `"unknown"` is the last resort if even `git` is unavailable --

// `FND-001c` (PRD `OPS-03`): "Source maps are produced for the deployed
// revision, uploaded to Sentry through an authenticated channel from the
// `FND-001b` pipeline, and never served publicly from Hosting."
//
// Three separate mechanisms, one per clause:
//
//  1. **Produced.** `build.sourcemap: "hidden"` below emits a map for every
//     chunk but omits the `//# sourceMappingURL=` comment, so nothing in the
//     shipped JavaScript advertises where a map would live.
//  2. **Uploaded authenticated.** This plugin uploads over HTTPS with
//     `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, which exists only as a CI secret (see `.env.example`).
//     It also injects debug IDs into both the chunk and its map, so Sentry
//     matches them by ID rather than by URL -- which is what makes clause 3
//     possible at all: the maps do not need to be reachable to be usable.
//  3. **Never served.** `filesToDeleteAfterUpload` removes the maps from the
//     build output once they are safely in Sentry, so `firebase deploy` has
//     nothing to publish. `firebase.json`'s `hosting.ignore` refuses to upload
//     `**/*.map` regardless, which is the guarantee that does not depend on
//     this plugin having run -- a local build, or a build with no Sentry
//     credentials, still cannot publish a map.
//
// Inactive unless all three values are present, so a local `bun run build` and
// the always-on CI `build` job neither need credentials nor contact Sentry.

  // A cold server took four such rounds to settle -- analytics, then the
  // Firebase SDK and Sentry, then the small utilities, then `tone` when the
  // first project editor mounted. In local dev that is a visible stutter; in
  // the emulator-backed E2E suite it was a real failure, because a reload
  // landing mid-test discards whatever interaction was in flight (it ate
  // `slice.spec.ts`'s "New Project" click, which then read as a broken
  // create-project flow). Declaring them here collapses all four rounds into
  // one startup cost.
  //
  // `tone` is the one that is easy to miss: nothing on the dashboard imports
  // it, so it is only discovered when a project page first mounts -- i.e.
  // always mid-session.

  // This is an optimization, not a contract: a dependency added later and
  // left out of this list still works, it just reintroduces one reload for
  // that dependency. `tests/e2e/emulator/warmDevServer.setup.ts` stays as the
