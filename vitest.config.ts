// bare specifier a second time, inside a nested git worktree (this repo's own
// agent workflow runs each task in one under `.claude/worktrees/`), can walk
// up past the worktree's own `node_modules` and land on the outer checkout's
// copy instead — which Vite then refuses to load as outside its project root,
// failing every single test file before it reaches a single assertion.
// Resolving it once, here, to an absolute path removes the second lookup
// entirely, so the correct local package is used regardless of nesting.
//
// Note this resolves to the package's **ESM** entry. `import.meta.resolve`
// honours the `import` condition; a `createRequire(...).resolve()` here would
// honour `require` and hand back `dist/vitest.js`, the CJS build, which
// `require()`s vitest and dies with "Vitest cannot be imported in a CommonJS
// module" on every file.

 * with a populated `.env` therefore ran a different suite than CI, which sets
 * none of them: `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` switched `libraryUrl` to its
 * percent-encoded Cloud Storage form, `VITE_DEV_BACKEND` moved
 * `firebaseConfig` onto emulator placeholders, and `VITE_RELEASE_SHA` replaced
 * the `"unknown"` sentinel. That is a suite whose result depends on deployment
 * state, and it is how a non-terminating loop in `search.test.ts` sat
 * undetected behind fixtures that silently resolved to zero assets.
 *
 * Pinning them empty here makes a local run reproduce CI exactly. It is not a
 * substitute for covering the other branch: the configured-bucket form is
 * asserted directly by passing the value in — `libraryUrl(key, BUCKET)` in
 * `src/library/manifest.test.ts` — which is how these should be tested, rather

/**
 * The unit and component suite, split into named projects along the
 * architecture's own layers (see `docs/architecture.html`).
 *
 * This is a *filtering* device, not a coverage boundary: the projects below
 * partition exactly the files one config collected before, so `bun run
 * test:all` is the same suite it always was. What the split buys is running
 * one layer (`--project=audio`) and reading a failure or a slowdown as
 * belonging to a layer rather than to "the tests".
 *
 * `library-pipeline` is the one project that is *not* application code — it
 * covers the sample-library build tooling under `scripts/`, which an engineer
 * runs by hand and which changes infrequently. It is most of the suite's wall
 * clock, so `bun run test` leaves it out and `bun run test:library` runs it.
 * CI runs `bun run test:all`, which includes it, so nothing merges without it
 * having run — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
 *
 * Adding a new `src/` directory means adding it to one of these projects. A
 * file matched by no project is silently never run, and a file matched by two
 * runs twice — `bun run verify:test-projects` fails on either.
 *
 * **Requires Vitest 4.** This is the `test.projects` API. The `defineWorkspace`
 * file it replaced could not run `vite-plugin-solid` correctly: under a
 * workspace project the plugin's `configEnvironment` hook never received the
 * client conditions, `solid-js/web` resolved to `dist/server.js`, and every
 * component test died on "Client-only API called on the server side". The same
 * config file passed when run with `--config` and failed as a project, which
 * is what identified it as a workspace bug rather than a configuration error.
 *
 * The other two suites are separate again and share nothing with this file:
 * the Firebase Emulator suite is `tests/emulator/vitest.config.ts`, and the
 * Playwright browser suites are under `tests/e2e/`. See `docs/testing.md`.
